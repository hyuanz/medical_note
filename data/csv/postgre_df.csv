Blood in urine

HPI:
Afrodite Paxos presents for follow-up of kidney stones and hematuria. Patient continues to have blood in her urine today. She previously had a negative cystoscopy and imaging tests that confirmed kidney stones. An ultrasound from March 2024 showed no definitive stone but noted possible mild swelling of the right kidney. Patient reports right-sided flank pain that occurs when sitting for prolonged periods, describing it as ""jabbing"" pain that makes it difficult to catch her breath. She initially thought it might be sciatica and visited a chiropractor. Patient is planning a trip to Greece with her 92-year-old mother who has dementia. Patient reports significant caregiver stress as she cares for her mother from early morning until midnight daily.

Physical Exam:
Patient points to right flank area when describing pain. Pain appears to be positional and located higher than typical kidney pain.

Laboratory Results:
Urinalysis shows persistent hematuria.

Imaging Results:
Ultrasound from March 2024 showed no definitive stone but possible mild swelling of the right kidney.

Procedure:

Plan:
1. Nephrolithiasis/Hematuria - Chronic. Patient continues to have microscopic hematuria. Will order renal ultrasound to evaluate for kidney stones and to assess previously noted mild right kidney swelling. Will also order urine cytology to rule out malignancy. Pain described appears to be musculoskeletal rather than renal in origin based on location and positional nature. Will coordinate care with Dr. Forward and send all results. Follow up after ultrasound results; may consider CT scan if ultrasound shows persistent kidney swelling.","

You still do have some blood in the urine today.  You have had the negative cystoscopy.  All the imaging tests.  We know that you've got some stones.  I don't know.  Let's see.  When's the last time we got?  We have an ultrasound from last year actually.  An ultrasound from March of last year showed no definitive stone.  It discussed maybe some mild swelling of the right kidney.  So I should probably repeat that ultrasound today to make sure that that's not actually... Do you do it here?  No, I got to give you a prescription for that.  I have to go up there.  I'm trying to make a travel plan.  And I have my mom that she's 92.  Where are you traveling to?  Greece.  Oh my god.  When are you leaving?  It's a mess.  I'm trying to get the tickets.  But between my sister and my mom, it's... Why are you taking her to Greece if she's in her 90s and with dementia Can you leave her there?  I mean it'd be nice because that would be okay.  yeah i don't have to deal with this anymore.  no and so she could see her brother her brother's i don't know.  you think she'll know.  you think she'll know you know.  i just ask her sometimes you know this and that sometimes she doesn't recognize us.  yeah because your own kids you don't need to treat like this.  yeah yeah but uh no i think it's not easy.  she wants to go to her.  she's going to her father's house not her own mind.  you right her father's house.  yeah I said, your father's, don't tell me, you're not gonna tell me this.  And I said, no, don't you realize how old you are?  You're in your 90s, okay.  She goes, look at yourself.  I said, okay, but we're both in our own 90s.  I said, okay, do you understand that?  She doesn't realize, which is good, that she doesn't have her age.  Because she moves around better than she used to because of that.  Do you, is she living with you?  You take care of her?  That's hard.  It is.  That's why I have blood in my urine.  My sister, when she got married, never left the house.  My father said, stay here.  It's big.  Where do you have to go?  And her husband was comfortable.  They had two children, so they stayed there.  So they were amongst them.  My mother was an alcoholic.  She had everything done.  My sister never did one thing.  So now it's a rude awakening for my sister.  she's mad at the world.  But you see I'm trying to play the good sister.  Yeah, I leave my house early in the morning.  I'm there with her the whole entire day until 12 midnight Because my mother Alright, so I will print out a prescription for an ultrasound just to make sure there's no stones, no swelling in that right kidney.  Your urine analysis shows the blood but it always has.  I'm going to just send out one other urine test called the urine cytology just to make sure there's no cancer cells in the urine.  As long as the ultrasound is fine, you're good to go.  If the ultrasound still shows any swelling of the kidney, I may want to get a CAT scan, but you have no pain, no symptoms?  I do have pain.  Where?  Because I've had this for a long time.  It's on my right hand side.  It's right in here.  Okay.  When I sit too long, which I do because I'm stuck in the house.  I had really jabbing, I couldn't catch my breath.  Yeah.  Okay, and I thought, here we go.  This is it.  Um, but I went to the chiropractor thinking that maybe it's a sciatic or something because I find myself doing this.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're describing to me muscle or nerve type pain and it's lower than the kidney and it's based on up higher and it's also positional and so it sounds musculoskeletal, not kidney related, but we'll get an ultrasound.  You know, some people get used to it.  I said, what are you talking about?  You're used to pain.  There's no way.  Yeah.  Well, let's get an ultrasound to make sure the kidney looks okay.  Okay.  All right.  So, with this ultrasound, can you also put down if you can send it to Dr.  Forward?  You know, when he gets this cat standing, the ultrasound.  I'll try, yeah.  Because I thought we did.  And she says, no, you haven't done that for 90... I think I did it last year and I couldn't.  I'll try to send everything over.  Alright Aphrodite.  Thank you very much.  Good seeing you.  You can come and help too.  Good luck with your trip.  Alright.  Let's see if it happens.  If there's any, straight through that door.  If there's any problems, I'll reach out to you, okay?  The front desk will give you the?  Yeah, ultrasound prescription, yes.  Thank you very much.  The elevator's right here.  Yeah, yeah. ",fu,"- CPT Code: 76700

HPI: 
Follow-up visit. No new complaints. Good control of urinary symptoms with Rapaflo (silodosin) 8mg daily and Prostate S.R. vitamin supplement twice daily. Patient is not currently taking Trospium as previously prescribed. Patient has been maintaining PSA levels in the low 3s as his baseline, with current PSA at 3.9, showing a slight elevation.

Physical Exam:
Digital rectal examination performed.

Laboratory Results:
PSA: 3.9
Bladder scan: 4 mL

Imaging Results:

Procedure:

Plan:
1. Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) - Stable: Continue Silodosin 8mg daily. Patient to continue Prostate S.R. vitamin supplement twice daily. Behavioral modifications, decreasing fluid intake three hours prior to bedtime, and avoiding bladder irritants such as caffeine were discussed. Behavioral modifications, decreasing fluid intake three hours prior to bedtime, and avoiding bladder irritants such as caffeine, alcohol, spicy and acidic foods discussed.

2. Elevated PSA - Monitoring: Current PSA 3.9, slightly elevated from baseline in the low 3s. Will obtain 4K score today to assess risk for prostate cancer. If 4K score shows elevated risk, will consider prostate MRI. If 4K score is reassuring, will continue monitoring. Patient previously had 4K score in 2022. Will repeat PSA in 6 months. I had a discussion with the patient about the significance of elevated PSA. Most common etiologies are BPH, inflammation, infection, or an underlying tumor. The only definitive way to distinguish between these diagnoses is with a prostate biopsy. I have discussed the risks including but not limited to UTI, sepsis, hematuria, hematochezia, hematospermia, and urinary retention.

No, is he taking the vitamin prostate?  which one is he taking?  prostate SR The vitamin.  is he taking the prostate?  that's the one that I recommended.  Okay, so maybe he's not taking Trostian Because I had him on two meds, but he's doing okay, yeah, so then I would just stay the course.  his bladder scan is four ml.  so that's good.  his psa was 3.9. did it go up from the last time?  yeah he kind of lives in the threes.  um it's it's like for the like range.  yeah he kind of he's his baseline's in the low threes.  okay so we could.  um You know, maybe I'll send a 4k score today.  He's had that before.  It's a blood test.  He's had it in 2022.  It tells you if there's like, if you're increased risk for detecting prostate cancer.  So we'll send that today.  Yeah, continue the silidosin and the prostate SR.  And then if his 4k score comes back elevated risk, we may want to get an MRI.  prostate but it could be just a fluke you know.  yeah it may like.  it may come down on repeat and just monitor because every time i like not that i'm like on it.  but i'm on it yeah and i look at it and i'm like okay it's kind of i feel like sometimes it fluctuates it's higher and then it goes a little low and then yeah what i'll do is i'm going to give you some a lab script today for six months from now.  So I'll probably assuming the 4k score is good and we're gonna monitor.  I want to see him in six months with another PSA.  We'll draw right now.  Yeah, I'll have someone come draw it.  I have to do a rectal exam on him, okay Yeah, it takes two seconds.  I'll be after they draw all right, so we'll be back, okay We'll do a 4k for real. ",fu,"- CPT Code: 84153

Behavioral modifications, decreasing fluid intake three hours prior to bedtime, and avoiding bladder irritants such as caffeine were discussed. Behavioral modifications, decreasing fluid intake three hours prior to bedtime, and avoiding bladder irritants such as caffeine, alcohol, spicy and acidic foods discussed.

2. Elevated PSA - Monitoring: Current PSA 3.9, slightly elevated from baseline in the low 3s. Will obtain 4K score today to assess risk for prostate cancer. If 4K score shows elevated risk, will consider prostate MRI. If 4K score is reassuring, will continue monitoring. Patient previously had 4K score in 2022. Will repeat PSA in 6 months. I had a discussion with the patient about the significance of elevated PSA. Most common etiologies are BPH, inflammation, infection, or an underlying tumor. The only definitive way to distinguish between these diagnoses is with a prostate biopsy. I have discussed the risks including but not limited to UTI, sepsis, hematuria, hematochezia, hematospermia, and urinary retention.

Okay, so maybe he's not taking Trostian Because I had him on two meds, but he's doing okay, yeah, so then I would just stay the course.  his bladder scan is four ml.  so that's good.  his psa was 3.9. did it go up from the last time?  yeah he kind of lives in the threes.  um it's it's like for the like range.  yeah he kind of he's his baseline's in the low threes.  okay so we could.  um You know, maybe I'll send a 4k score today.  He's had that before.  It's a blood test.  He's had it in 2022.  It tells you if there's like, if you're increased risk for detecting prostate cancer.  So we'll send that today.  Yeah, continue the silidosin and the prostate SR.

So I'll probably assuming the 4k score is good and we're gonna monitor.  I want to see him in six months with another PSA.  We'll draw right now.  Yeah, I'll have someone come draw it.  I have to do a rectal exam on him, okay Yeah, it takes two seconds.  I'll be after they draw all right, so we'll be back, okay We'll do a 4k for real. "", 'diarized_transcript_csv_url': ''}"

Low testosterone

HPI:
Eric Amin is a 24-year-old male presenting for evaluation of low testosterone symptoms. He reports experiencing low energy, fatigue, and feeling sluggish despite getting 8 hours of sleep and maintaining good sleep hygiene with reduced screen time before bed. He also complains of decreased libido and difficulty maintaining erections. The patient has a history of thyroid abnormalities for which he has been taking thyroid medication for approximately 7 years. He states that he initially attributed his symptoms to thyroid issues but decided to get his testosterone checked out of curiosity. Recent lab work showed a testosterone level of 2.95, which is considered low for his age. His TSH is currently elevated at 4.9 with T4 at 1.89. He reports the TSH elevation may be related to switching between generic and brand name thyroid medication. The patient maintains a good diet and sleep habits.

Physical Exam:
Genitourinary: Testicles normal on examination.

Laboratory Results:
Testosterone: 2.95
TSH: 4.9
T4: 1.89

GFR: 94
Cholesterol: 177
A1C: 5.5

Imaging Results:

Procedure:

Plan:
1. Hypogonadism, acute - Testosterone level is low at 2.95 for a 24-year-old male. Will obtain comprehensive hormone panel including total and free testosterone, sex hormone binding globulin, LH, FSH, estradiol, and prolactin. Patient instructed to complete testing before 9 AM due to circadian rhythm of testosterone. Will consider Clomid therapy rather than direct testosterone supplementation given patient's young age and potential fertility concerns.

2. Hypothyroidism, chronic - Patient has been on thyroid medication for 7 years. Current TSH elevated at 4.9 with T4 at 1.89. Elevation may be related to switching between generic and brand medication. Will continue current management.

3. Erectile dysfunction, acute - Patient reports difficulty maintaining erections. Will reassess after hormone evaluation is complete.

Follow-up appointment scheduled in 1-2 weeks to review laboratory results and discuss treatment options.","

","test_name: full testosterone hormone panel, test_due_duration: before 10 a.m., estimated_test_due_date: ","Speaker 0: Mr.  Amen.  Is it Amen or Evan?  I don't know, it doesn't matter.  What do you say?  Amen.  I'm in.  Eric.  Dr.  Berman, how are you?  Good, how are you?  I am alright.  So, let's see.  They sent you here to me for some blood work abnormalities, I believe, right?  Your testosterone level?  Okay.  Your testosterone level was... 295.  You are 24 years old.  Excuse me.  You also have some thyroid abnormalities, do you know about that?  Yeah, I'm taking thyroid medication.  Taking thyroid medication, okay.  Your TSH was initially elevated now.  That was an abnormality.  Okay, but it is still elevated at 4.3 or sorry 4.9 your TSH Medication.  so you've been on thyroid medication for a while.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Got it Okay, so tell me what's going on with the testosterone.  Yeah, for a 24 year old, definitely on the low side.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  So, and the symptoms you're feeling include what?  Low energy?  Good job.  Tough, I know.  Believe me, I'm 50 and I feel the same.  And libido wise too.  Okay.  So trouble with libido, any trouble with the actual erections or they're okay?  It's hard to maintain.  Okay.  All right.  So first step is to check a full sort of testosterone hormone panel, which includes your total and your free testosterone.  something called sex hormone binding globulin LH FSH estradiol and prolactin.  Okay, so I'm gonna give you the full panel of testosterone blood work.  That needs to be done early in the morning.  So before 10 a.m.  Even before 9 a.m Doesn't matter so much.  stomach wise I guess you could do an energy something.  it matters the timing.  the Testosterone levels have a circadian rhythm meaning they change with the time of the day.  So you want to check it early in the morning.  Let me examine you.  Stand up.  Pants another way down.  And we're not.  typically when people come in, even at a young age with low testosterone, we don't find any major abnormalities.  We just find that the testicles are sluggish, if you will.  But if we do find something and you do have other endocrine issues, I guess it's possible, right?  So your testicles feel totally normal, which is expected.  So let's see, we'll check the blood work, I'll bring it back in a week or two, we'll go over it and we'll see what we may or may not want to do.  Right, there's a wide range of things.  In younger guys, like you, it is a little bit more tricky to replace the testosterone for two reasons.  One is, you may potentially still have interest in your fertility.  If we give you testosterone supplementation, it could negatively affect sperm production.  Which is not desirable.  The other problem with testosterone supplementation in a young guy is dependence.  Like you basically wind up being on it life long a lot of times.  Now we have ways of doing testosterone supplementation in a younger guy.  that's not, what we want to avoid is just giving you testosterone.  Okay, because if we give you testosterone and that's really the only way to do it is only pills.  Your body is going to shut down its production because it's going to turn off the feedback loops and your testicles are going to say, oh, look at that.  There's a lot of testosterone.  I don't need to work anymore.  And then you'll be on a lifelong.  There is a medication called Clomid, which is a medication that actually stimulates the brain hormones to generate potentially sperm and testosterone.  So That way is sort of a better way to do it in a young patient.  It's not testosterone supplementation in the classic sense.  It's a medication that will sort of help your body do it on its own, sort of.  So in a younger patient, that's what I prefer to do.  But let's see what the numbers look like.  And we'll take it from there.  Very good.  That's a story.  They will give you papers up front for the blood work and they'll make you that follow-up appointment.  You're gonna head right through that door, okay? ",new,"- CPT Code: 84520

So before 10 a.m.  Even before 9 a.m Doesn't matter so much.  stomach wise I guess you could do an energy something.  it matters the timing.  the Testosterone levels have a circadian rhythm meaning they change with the time of the day.  So you want to check it early in the morning.  Let me examine you.  Stand up.  Pants another way down.  And we're not.  typically when people come in, even at a young age with low testosterone, we don't find any major abnormalities.  We just find that the testicles are sluggish, if you will.  But if we do find something and you do have other endocrine issues, I guess it's possible, right?  So your testicles feel totally normal, which is expected.  So let's see, we'll check the blood work, I'll bring it back in a week or two, we'll go over it and we'll see what we may or may not want to do.  Right, there's a wide range of things.  In younger guys, like you, it is a little bit more tricky to replace the testosterone for two reasons.  One is, you may potentially still have interest in your fertility.  If we give you testosterone supplementation, it could negatively affect sperm production.  Which is not desirable.  The other problem with testosterone supplementation in a young guy is dependence.  Like you basically wind up being on it life long a lot of times.  Now we have ways of doing testosterone supplementation in a younger guy.  that's not, what we want to avoid is just giving you testosterone.  Okay, because if we give you testosterone and that's really the only way to do it is only pills.  Your body is going to shut down its production because it's going to turn off the feedback loops and your testicles are going to say, oh, look at that.  There's a lot of testosterone.  I don't need to work anymore.  And then you'll be on a lifelong.  There is a medication called Clomid, which is a medication that actually stimulates the brain hormones to generate potentially sperm and testosterone.  So That way is sort of a better way to do it in a young patient.  It's not testosterone supplementation in the classic sense.  It's a medication that will sort of help your body do it on its own, sort of.  So in a younger patient, that's what I prefer to do.  But let's see what the numbers look like.  And we'll take it from there.  Very good.  That's a story.  They will give you papers up front for the blood work and they'll make you that follow-up appointment.  You're gonna head right through that door, okay? "", 'diarized_transcript_csv_url': ''}"

",,"Speaker 0: I already had the book this time, so I'll take a peek at it.  Let's see.  All right.  So cholesterol, quite good.  131.  Your LDL is 58, so that's good.  Sugar was 130.  Kidney function was good.  So A1C 7.2, you know, not terrible, but, you know, it's a little higher than it was before. 
Speaker 1: So I want to up my diet a little bit.  All right. 
Speaker 0: So I got to get back to it.  I don't think you have to go on any more medication now.  So that's all right.  Now, are you OK with prescriptions?  Do you have enough of everything?  The guardians, they just came to my last one. 
Speaker 1: So they're going to either call you or. 
Speaker 0: Well, I'll send it in now.  Yeah.  Where are you getting it from these days?  Acne. 
Speaker 1: Acne?  Last week I got it and that's on the bottom.  No more freaks out there. 
Speaker 0: Well, let's take care of that right now. 
Speaker 1: But all the rest of them are good. 
Speaker 0: Yeah, okay. 
Speaker 1: Other than that, I just had cataracts around my right eye last week. 
Speaker 0: It worked pretty well? 
Speaker 1: Yeah, it did the laser work. 
Speaker 0: So you feel like your vision is pretty good now? 
Speaker 1: Yeah.  It still always feels like there's always something in there, but they said that's going to go away.  It takes like six weeks to heal. 
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's still.  it's pretty pretty amazing surgery.  when you think about it I think I'm always impressed with it even though I mean, it's one of the most common things done.  I mean with people.  we clear people for that surgery and I bet you five six of them.  Oh It's common.  Are you doing some walking or other?  Oh, yeah Jim, please Jim, please Just relax and listen to the heart Sounds okay Have you been to the the heart doctor at all? 
Speaker 1: Yeah, how to go get a EKG and all that sort of well for the surgery. 
Speaker 0: Yeah all right, so you're up to date with.  You're up to date with all that.  Let me see.  Have you done a colonoscopy?  No, not yet.  You gonna, or you just don't want to do it? 
Speaker 1: I'm gonna do it. 
Speaker 0: Okay. 
Speaker 1: I'm gonna go home and tell Johnny to make me a plan. 
Speaker 0: Okay.  Alright, you're up to date with your shots, so that's good.  All right, I just think all you really got to do is get a little tighter with the diet there and you'll be okay.  You've had, let me see, what else was I gonna say?  I guess you've had all that.  Okay, so you've had all the shots, so that's good.  All right, so I would say, yeah, just get after the diet, then we'll see how good you are in the three or four months.  Those pills that you gave me to Kind of like lose weight.  Mm-hmm.  I didn't lose out anything.  No nothing.  I mean your your I mean your weights not really that bad.  I mean you're you know, your body mass index is 28.8.  I mean, you know obesity is when you're over 30, so I just don't like the belly.  Yeah, I know.  Neither do I, but it's hard to lose. 
Speaker 1: In the leather pill that you gave me for erection, I don't work either.  I don't even... You used to be able to get up in the morning and flip your pancakes, but not anymore. 
Speaker 0: I don't know what to tell you about that.  If you go to one of the urologists, there's other things they can do besides the pills.  They have other, but these are treatments that you apply right down here.  You'd have to talk to them about that.  You have a urologist or no? 
Speaker 1: No, I think he's gone. 
Speaker 0: He retired.  Okay.  But that's where I would point you if you wanted to do anything more about that. 
Speaker 1: All right.  Okay.  Okay. 
Speaker 0: Alright, so get to the diet and I'll see you sometime in the fall. ",fu,"- CPT Code: 66984

Evaluation and management of recurrent perianal squamous cell carcinoma

DISEASE HISTORY:
Patient is a 63 year old HIV + pt who has a complex history of perianal disease. 
2009: He had excision of anal warts (condyloma acuminatum), positive for HSV. 
2011:  He had biopsies of perianal lesions, negative for malignancy. 
2012: In March of 2012, he had wide excision of perianal lesion (9 cm) with gluteal flap, with plastic surgery for skin grafting. Pathology of the wide excision showed HPV infection (focal equivocal) but no documented cancer. 
2013: The patient subsequently received radiation therapy from March 10, 2013 to April 10, 2013, with 3,600 cGy delivered to the perineum and a nodule. He had multiple resections of perianal warts before and after 2015. He also has a history of surgery for squamous cell carcinoma of scrotum. 
2023: Patient underwent colonoscopy in 2023 by Dr. Scully which showed polyps and a wound near the left anus, but biopsies were negative for malignancy.
2025: A repeat colonoscopy by Dr. Scully revealed moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma on the left perianal area. HSV and HPV testing were negative on current biopsy. CT scan performed on 4-7-2025 showed a 7mm right upper lobe lung nodule, unchanged, and minimal stranding/inflammation in the left perianal tissues with no other significant findings. Patient reports pain with sitting following recent biopsy and occasional bleeding with wiping. Patient also reports intermittent pain in back, legs, and chest since the biopsy procedure.

INTERVAL HISTORY:
06/18/25: Patient presents for follow-up of recurrent perianal squamous cell carcinoma. Reports continued pain in the perianal area with drainage and odor. Patient has completed 2 infusions with infectious disease specialist Dr. Nahass for HSV treatment, with 2 additional infusions planned for Friday and approximately 7/7/25. Dr. Nahass has cleared patient to coordinate cancer treatment with chemoradiation. Patient received 5 days of antibiotics from Dr. Saeed for inflammation in left buttock area and was told the area looks better and he can start radiation. Patient has upcoming radiation oncology appointment on Friday. Reports pain in groin area when walking. Also reports nighttime cough which may be related to asthma.

ALLERGIES:
No known allergies
No known drug allergies

MEDICATIONS:
Continued medications: Dovato 50 mg-300 mg tablet, rosuvastatin 10 mg tablet.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
The ROS is negative in 12 point detail except for the pertinent positives and negatives listed in HPI and below

OBJECTIVE:
Physical Examination:
Gen: Well developed well nourished. HEENT:PERRLA,EOMI, sclera anicteric, oropharynx clear. Nodes: No peripheral adenopathy. Chest: Clear bilaterally. Heart: S1 S2 no murmurs, regular heartbeat. Abd: Soft, +BS, non tender and non distended, no masses, no organomegaly. Ext: No edema. Skin: Perianal area shows approximately 2x2 cm open wound with drainage. Area appears smaller than on previous examination. Neuro: motor and sensory grossly intact. Musculoskeletal: Normal gait.

IMPRESSION:
Recurrent moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the perianal skin, left side. Patient has complex history of perianal disease with prior wide excision in 2012 and radiation therapy from 3-12-2013 to 4-10-2013. Current biopsy confirms moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, now HSV and HPV negative. CT scan from 4-7-2025 shows minimal inflammatory changes in the left perianal region without evidence of metastatic disease. PET scan has identified lymph node involvement in the groin area. 
Just completed short course of therapy for HSV. Now ID feels we can start Nigro protocol. Coordinating with Rad Onc. He has already had teaching for Xeloda and Mitomycin. Awaiting radiation oncology to determine start date for coordinated treatment approach.  Plastic surgery evaluation may be needed to assess wound healing potential. Blood counts remain adequate for treatment initiation. 
History of recurrent condyloma acuminatum (anal warts) with multiple prior excisions. Complex history of recurrent perianal disease dating back to 2009. Initial diagnosis of condyloma acuminatum positive for HSV in 2009. Multiple subsequent excisions between 2009-2015 for recurrent disease. Patient currently receiving targeted antiviral therapy with Dr. Nahass with 2 infusions completed and 2 additional sessions planned. Dr. Nahass reports improvement in inflammatory changes in left buttock area following antibiotic treatment. Concurrent HSV treatment being coordinated with cancer therapy as patient has dual pathology contributing to perianal disease process.
HIV positive, currently undetectable on medication. Currently maintained on Dovato with undetectable viral load. Followed regularly by infectious disease specialist Dr. Nahass every 3 months. Will coordinate cancer treatment plan with Dr. Nahass to ensure comprehensive care.
7mm right upper lobe lung nodule, unchanged from prior imaging. Stability suggests benign etiology. Will continue surveillance as part of routine cancer follow-up.
Lymphadenopathy in groin area noted on PET scan, likely related to primary perianal malignancy. 

PLAN:
Coordinating chemoradiation treatment with radiation oncology and infectious disease.
Ordered IV and oral chemotherapy to be administered once radiation start date is confirmed.
Patient to continue oral chemotherapy pills during radiation treatment.
Sent message to radiation oncologist to coordinate start date for comprehensive treatment.
Will monitor CBC and other labs every 1-2 weeks during treatment.
Monitor for treatment side effects including hand-foot syndrome, mucositis, and bleeding as well as cytopenias.
Continue infectious disease management with Dr. Nahass who has cleared patient for concurrent treatments.
Patient to have two more infusions with infectious disease (one this Friday and one on approximately 07/07/25).
Follow up in 2 weeks after treatment initiation.

Patient has given prior verbal consent to have the conversation recorded and summarized by the Knowtex software.","

And he feels that we can now coordinate starting the IV and the pills. Right. And with the radiation. Right. He wasn't ready yet, but he said it was much better now. And he said, so have you seen the radiation doctor? Do we know when... I'll see her Friday. Okay, because... um we would start we want to coordinate right we want to coordinate everything and um and i don't know i don't know if he's i just want to make sure that we that we like coordinate um right yeah because friday i go to the radiation. To meet them. Right, and they'll tell me when, because winter starts. whatever, it's a lady doctor, when we can, I guess, start, and then they want to look, I guess, where they put the markings, because they did all of that already, you know, but I don't know if they came off or what, you know, so, um, then Friday I got to go, he wants me do another infusion would that interfere with like with the with the um no he said that we could start Yeah, yeah, I know, yeah, but he still want me do one of the infusion. We're going to... Yes, he said he's going to continue doing his thing. But would that mess me up? I mean, with all that? You mean doing his thing and doing... Yeah, because I got sick as a dog last week when I did it. Yeah, he said, I mean, he said no, and... And I'm just, I mean, he said that you'd be okay doing his thing and our thing. That won't be too much on my, okay. Yeah, that's what he said. I know he told me that too, but he wanted me do two more sessions. He want me do Friday and then a week after. Right. And then, But he said I have the message He said that we could start doing the radiation. Yeah, he told me, yeah. And the way it is, is you get the pills. I got the pills. And then, but there's one IV. Remember we talked about that? Right, right. So now that I know we're going to start you, I'm going to order you officially for that. Okay. Because I wasn't ordering it because I didn't want them to start calling you being like, hey, can you come in for this? and you're like, no, no, no, no, I can't. Yeah, because they did call on last week about some pills. About the pills. And I said, he hasn't started. He had. Can you come in for this? And you're like, no, no, no, no, I can't. Yeah, because they did call on last week about some pills. About the pills and refilled. And I said, he hasn't started. I said, don't leave the guy alone. And they're like, is he not going to do it? And I was like, and I was like, yeah, so I was like, we're going to do it. It's just that we, you know. Okay, so I'm just ordering that. And then they need to. So I have to come here to do the ivy? Yes, but the IV is only once. Oh, okay, hold on the head. Is there a big bag? Of the one? No. Will it get me sick in the beginning? No, and did they, they said that they gave you some education, but it might have been. Oh, yes. But it probably was too long ago, but no. Remember how they said you some education, but it might have been, but it probably was too long ago. But no, remember how they said you wouldn't get sick with it? Right, right. Yeah, the girl, the young lady, she told me the, you know, different signs. Exactly, went to call, when to, exactly. So what we need to do is I'm going to make sure, I'm going to send a message to the radiation doctor just so they know that when they're going to start we want to exactly so I'm writing I just saw him um please let me know when he's starting so we can coordinate because i don't want you to start the pills or the iv until they say um i'm coming this day right but they didn't give you a start day they're still going to measure it out right okay right they want me coming at 10 30 okay and then did did dr nahas do any blood work? Do we know if your blood work is okay? He did blood work. And she just did blood work too. Oh, I asked for a blood count because I wanted to make sure that his drug didn't make you anemic. Your blood count is fine. Oh, okay. Yeah, I asked them to, I forgot. I did ask them to check it. Okay. So you're perfect in that regard. And then, um, and then we're just waiting to hear the start day. Okay. Okay. Now, do you think is the rectum, is that whole area better? Um No I still have pain But does he Because he thought I'm just like better um no I still have pain like but does he because he thought I'm just like looking. I don't know. It's, to me, it had got a little bigger, last time you saw it, but but do you think it's getting less? It's draining, like. Okay. Like, it's a smell like a drink, like, you know, I have to wear my pads like that. Right, like he said that, I'm just looking at what he said. So Dr. Said said, it's still a little bit in flames in the left buttock area, but it looks better. Yeah, he gave. me, now doctors, he gave me some antibiotic for that. I had to take five days, and I saw him Friday, and he said looks better, and I can start radiation. Okay, and then, and how many infusions? Already did two. Okay, and they're going to do one more. Well, he's talking about two more one Friday and then the other one I think July the 7th or something like that okay okay if you don't think I need it but tell him no he he really the issue is is that he's concerned that part of yes the anal cancer needs to be treated but he also thinks that part of it is the um that the um that the herpes is causing the problem and he wants to make sure that he treats that and that's why he gave you the medicine. Oh, wow. So, um, okay, okay. Now, another thing, um, when they did the, when I did the pet test, they said, Dr. Sahin said that he saw a little cancer in the groin. A lymph node. The groin. Groyin, a lymph node. Is that what it is? Yeah, but that's why they're going to give you the radiation to cover that. Oh, okay. No, he mentioned that to me too. Because I get pain right in here if I walk along. I don't think the... Yeah, but that's why they're going to give you the radiation to cover that. Oh, okay. No, he mentioned that to me too. Because I get pain right in here if I walk along. I don't think the... lymph node would cause you pain, but it might be partially from the area, from the fact that you're having this treatment. So I think you're doing the right thing. So the goal would be once you're getting the treatment that first Dr. Nahas was treating the HSV. We're treating the cancer, and the goal is for all of that area to look normal down the road. But you have two different processes going on I don't know that the groin would be hurting you because the groin is a lymph node in the front. Yeah, but that's where I have my pain. I have it right old. I get it right up in here. Maybe, but usually a small node wouldn't cause you pain. Well, no, so if you have that pain go away, then we'll think maybe it was the lymph node that got better. Right. So, okay, so I checked your counts. We're going to try to start you once. I just sent a message to them to let me know day one. And then while you're on the treatment, you know, you'll probably probably come in here every one to two weeks because we want to check your blood counts. Okay. And also make sure you're not having bleeding, that you're not having anything that would be related to the chemo. Right. Okay. Because the pills might start you problems with like hand, like... That what she said, hand feet. Yeah, exactly. Our mouth so we have to, we just have to make sure of everything. Okay. Some people get and some don't get that. Exactly. You might of nothing. Yeah. So, I know, I know, I know. So can I take a look at you really? to make sure of everything. Some people get and some don't get that. Exactly. You might have nothing. Yeah. So, I know, I know, I know. So can I take a look at you really? Okay. Can you sit and I'll take a listen? Yeah, I got my pad on. Because it's like, um, I just want to do an external look. I'm just curious to see if it looks less swollen. Hold on. I'll come behind you just to see. I just want to take a quick look. Okay. And then, let me just put it. Well, I apologize. Where are they who they are? Since that flu, that flu must have to apologize. Where are they who they are? Since that flu, that flu must take taking the point the flu might be taking what no I mean the fluid was I'm taking now because I I discharged like like let me see so you feel like it's much better I'm like well I think it's smaller you don't think it's smaller I didn't really look at it because this area right here was much bigger prior. Right. Now it's just a small, like, two by two centuries yeah and it's a smell like yeah and that's that's to be expected because I think but I do think it's going to get better okay and then do you want to sit here so is it hurting you it's some I have this let me put this can I put this in here oh sure okay let me just wash my no worries um it's seven ways I got to sit and even lay down. Because if I lay on that side with a, it's like it start hurting. Right. Okay, so you want me to sit here? Yeah, I just want to take a quick listen. You can pull your pants up and get comfortable. I just want to listen to your heart in the lungs. Okay. And you know, I have a big coughing. I don't know if that's my asthma acting out. You know, so. Let me take a listen. Yeah. Okay. and I don't know if that's my asthma acting up, you know. Let me take a listen. Yeah, okay. Yeah, I don't know if it's my asthma. What? At nighttime, mostly. Yes. I can sit on your side is better. Take a deep back. They'll like sound okay. Oh, okay. Oh, okay. Oh, okay. Now you're good to get like that. Okay, your heart and lungs sound good. Now before you go, the last thing you want, did, where do you feel that lymph node or the pain? Because I can make sure it's nothing swollen. Okay, can I stand up? Absolutely. Whatever is more comfortable for you. It's hard for me. Can I? Oh, I can't. I'm right.",fu,"- CPT Code: 17381

Yeah, so I spoke to Dr. Nahas. Right. And he feels that we can now coordinate starting the IV and the pills. Right. And with the radiation. Right. He wasn't ready yet, but he said it was much better now. And he said, so have you seen the radiation doctor? Do we know when... I'll see her Friday. Okay, because... um we would start we want to coordinate right we want to coordinate everything and um and i don't know i don't know if he's i just want to make sure that we that we like coordinate um right yeah because friday i go to the radiation. To meet them. Right, and they'll tell me when, because winter starts. whatever, it's a lady doctor, when we can, I guess, start, and then they want to look, I guess, where they put the markings, because they did all of that already, you know, but I don't know if they came off or what, you know, so, um, then Friday I got to go, he wants me do another infusion would that interfere with like with the with the um no he said that we could start Yeah, yeah, I know, yeah, but he still want me do one of the infusion. We're going to... Yes, he said he's going to continue doing his thing. But would that mess me up? I mean, with all that? You mean doing his thing and doing... Yeah, because I got sick as a dog last week when I did it. Yeah, he said, I mean, he said no, and... And I'm just, I mean, he said that you'd be okay doing his thing and our thing. That won't be too much on my, okay. Yeah, that's what he said. I know he told me that too, but he wanted me do two more sessions. He want me do Friday and then a week after. Right. And then, But he said I have the message He said that we could start doing the radiation. Yeah, he told me, yeah. And the way it is, is you get the pills. I got the pills. And then, but there's one IV. Remember we talked about that? Right, right. So now that I know we're going to start you, I'm going to order you officially for that. Okay. Because I wasn't ordering it because I didn't want them to start calling you being like, hey, can you come in for this? and you're like, no, no, no, no, I can't. Yeah, because they did call on last week about some pills. About the pills. And I said, he hasn't started. He had. Can you come in for this? And you're like, no, no, no, no, I can't. Yeah, because they did call on last week about some pills. About the pills and refilled. And I said, he hasn't started. I said, don't leave the guy alone. And they're like, is he not going to do it? And I was like, and I was like, yeah, so I was like, we're going to do it. It's just that we, you know. Okay, so I'm just ordering that. And then they need to. So I have to come here to do the ivy? Yes, but the IV is only once. Oh, okay, hold on the head. Is there a big bag? Of the one? No. Will it get me sick in the beginning? No, and did they, they said that they gave you some education, but it might have been. Oh, yes. But it probably was too long ago, but no. Remember how they said you some education, but it might have been, but it probably was too long ago. But no, remember how they said you wouldn't get sick with it? Right, right. Yeah, the girl, the young lady, she told me the, you know, different signs. Exactly, went to call, when to, exactly. So what we need to do is I'm going to make sure, I'm going to send a message to the radiation doctor just so they know that when they're going to start we want to exactly so I'm writing I just saw him um please let me know when he's starting so we can coordinate because i don't want you to start the pills or the iv until they say um i'm coming this day right but they didn't give you a start day they're still going to measure it out right okay right they want me coming at 10 30 okay and then did did dr nahas do any blood work? Do we know if your blood work is okay? He did blood work. And she just did blood work too. Oh, I asked for a blood count because I wanted to make sure that his drug didn't make you anemic. Your blood count is fine. Oh, okay. Yeah, I asked them to, I forgot. I did ask them to check it. Okay. So you're perfect in that regard. And then, um, and then we're just waiting to hear the start day. Okay. Okay. Now, do you think is the rectum, is that whole area better? Um No I still have pain But does he Because he thought I'm just like better um no I still have pain like but does he because he thought I'm just like looking. I don't know. It's, to me, it had got a little bigger, last time you saw it, but but do you think it's getting less? It's draining, like. Okay. Like, it's a smell like a drink, like, you know, I have to wear my pads like that. Right, like he said that, I'm just looking at what he said. So Dr. Said said, it's still a little bit in flames in the left buttock area, but it looks better. Yeah, he gave. me, now doctors, he gave me some antibiotic for that. I had to take five days, and I saw him Friday, and he said looks better, and I can start radiation. Okay, and then, and how many infusions? Already did two. Okay, and they're going to do one more. Well, he's talking about two more one Friday and then the other one I think July the 7th or something like that okay okay if you don't think I need it but tell him no he he really the issue is is that he's concerned that part of yes the anal cancer needs to be treated but he also thinks that part of it is the um that the um that the herpes is causing the problem and he wants to make sure that he treats that and that's why he gave you the medicine. Oh, wow. So, um, okay, okay. Now, another thing, um, when they did the, when I did the pet test, they said, Dr. Sahin said that he saw a little cancer in the groin. A lymph node. The groin. Groyin, a lymph node. Is that what it is? Yeah, but that's why they're going to give you the radiation to cover that. Oh, okay. No, he mentioned that to me too. Because I get pain right in here if I walk along. I don't think the... Yeah, but that's why they're going to give you the radiation to cover that. Oh, okay. No, he mentioned that to me too. Because I get pain right in here if I walk along. I don't think the... lymph node would cause you pain, but it might be partially from the area, from the fact that you're having this treatment. So I think you're doing the right thing. So the goal would be once you're getting the treatment that first Dr. Nahas was treating the HSV. We're treating the cancer, and the goal is for all of that area to look normal down the road. But you have two different processes going on I don't know that the groin would be hurting you because the groin is a lymph node in the front. Yeah, but that's where I have my pain. I have it right old. I get it right up in here. Maybe, but usually a small node wouldn't cause you pain. Well, no, so if you have that pain go away, then we'll think maybe it was the lymph node that got better. Right. So, okay, so I checked your counts. We're going to try to start you once. I just sent a message to them to let me know day one. And then while you're on the treatment, you know, you'll probably probably come in here every one to two weeks because we want to check your blood counts. Okay. And also make sure you're not having bleeding, that you're not having anything that would be related to the chemo. Right. Okay. Because the pills might start you problems with like hand, like... That what she said, hand feet. Yeah, exactly. Our mouth so we have to, we just have to make sure of everything. Okay. Some people get and some don't get that. Exactly. You might of nothing. Yeah. So, I know, I know, I know. So can I take a look at you really? to make sure of everything. Some people get and some don't get that. Exactly. You might have nothing. Yeah. So, I know, I know, I know. So can I take a look at you really? Okay. Can you sit and I'll take a listen? Yeah, I got my pad on. Because it's like, um, I just want to do an external look. I'm just curious to see if it looks less swollen. Hold on. I'll come behind you just to see. I just want to take a quick look. Okay. And then, let me just put it. Well, I apologize. Where are they who they are? Since that flu, that flu must have to apologize. Where are they who they are? Since that flu, that flu must take taking the point the flu might be taking what no I mean the fluid was I'm taking now because I I discharged like like let me see so you feel like it's much better I'm like well I think it's smaller you don't think it's smaller I didn't really look at it because this area right here was much bigger prior. Right. Now it's just a small, like, two by two centuries yeah and it's a smell like yeah and that's that's to be expected because I think but I do think it's going to get better okay and then do you want to sit here so is it hurting you it's some I have this let me put this can I put this in here oh sure okay let me just wash my no worries um it's seven ways I got to sit and even lay down. Because if I lay on that side with a, it's like it start hurting. Right. Okay, so you want me to sit here? Yeah, I just want to take a quick listen. You can pull your pants up and get comfortable. I just want to listen to your heart in the lungs. Okay. And you know, I have a big coughing. I don't know if that's my asthma acting out. You know, so. Let me take a listen. Yeah. Okay. and I don't know if that's my asthma acting up, you know. Let me take a listen. Yeah, okay. Yeah, I don't know if it's my asthma. What? At nighttime, mostly. Yes. I can sit on your side is better. Take a deep back. They'll like sound okay. Oh, okay. Oh, okay. Oh, okay. Now you're good to get like that. Okay, your heart and lungs sound good.

PATIENT: Cabrera, Tairy
REFERRING PROVIDER: 

CHIEF COMPLAINT: Evaluation and management of an alleged diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Tairy Cabrera, a 37-year-old female, presents to establish care with a allege diagnosed of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) diagnosed in February 2024. She has been on hydroxychloroquine since May 2024. She states she was seen by a rheumatologist in Jersey City who recently retired in December. At that point in time according to her husband it was not completely clear if she truly had lupus. As per husband was translating for her while question was if she had a combination of lupus and possibly rheumatoid arthritis even though all the markers specifically associated with those 2 diseases were negative and she had a mildly positive ANA. She was placed on hydroxychloroquine and according to the patient she stated she felt well on it. Eventually she had become pregnant and she discontinued the medication. Unfortunately she lost her pregnancy and since then she restarted the medication but it seems to not be effective. She reports symptoms including palpitations, dizziness, numbness in hands and feet, generalized pain, sleep disruptions/poor, and a history of Raynaud's phenomenon. She reports multiple ER visits due to palpitations and severe fatigue. Peripheral blood tests in January 2024 revealed a positive ANA (1:80), WBC count of 4.5, hemoglobin 14.8 g/dL, hematocrit 44.4%, and platelet count 312. Absolute lymphocyte count was 2223 within normal limits. Urinalysis showed no protein or blood presence. The patient reports being treated for anxiety and is on Nadolol and Fluoxetine but states persistent symptoms, particularly pain and fatigue. Notably, she experienced the loss of a child due to pregnancy complications in September 2024. There is a noted familial history of similar symptoms in a cousin. Recent evaluations raise the question of fibromyalgia, supported by symptoms such as widespread musculoskeletal pain, sleep disturbances, and cognitive disturbances (brain fog), exacerbated by stress, diffuse discomfort when her child hugs her. In addition when she was young she was very flexible and she can currently touch her thumb to her forearms bilaterally. She has mild hyperextension's of her elbow. She can still touch the floor flat with her hands she has easy bruising and she has a history of heavy painful periods. She also has some dizziness from lying down to sitting up position or sitting up to standing she also has palpitations and anxiety. In addition she has diarrhea alternating with constipation.

INTERVAL HISTORY:
6/27/25: Patient reports she has been walking more for exercise. She has not tried aqua therapy yet despite having the information. Patient reports having an eye infection for 2 weeks that has not resolved despite antibiotic eye drops prescribed at an emergency room for conjunctivitis. She reports eye dryness with persistent cough. The right eye appears red and is itchy, particularly bothersome at night. Patient denies any vision changes.  She has not seen an ophthalmologist.  She does not have any allergies that she knows of.  No other new medical issues reported. Patient has not tried magnesium supplementation for muscle relaxation.  Since stopping hydroxychloroquine she has seen no difference in terms of her fibromyalgia symptoms.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
The ROS is negative in 12 point detail except for the pertinent positives and negatives listed in HPI and below

OBJECTIVE:
Physical Examination:
Gen: Well developed well nourished. 
HEENT: PERRLA, EOMI, sclera erythematous, more on the left than right eye. 
Chest: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. 
Heart: Normal S1 S2, regular rate and rhythm. 
Ext: No edema. 
Skin: No skin rash. 
Musculoskeletal: No swelling noted in any of the joints in both the upper or lower extremities. Fibromyalgia trigger points 18 out of 18.

ASSESSMENT:
Positive ANA
Patient has a low positive ANA (1:80). All other rheumatological markers associated with a positive ANA came back negative. Protein/creatinine ratio was within normal limits. Urinalysis on repeat was negative. Based on comprehensive testing, as of now, there is insufficient evidence to support a SLE diagnosis.

Fibromyalgia
Patient continues to have symptoms consistent with fibromyalgia. We have discontinued hydroxychloroquine, and patient has not noticed any difference in terms of being on the medication and being off the medication. Patient is reiterated treatment options for fibromyalgia including aqua therapy, Tai Chi, stress reduction techniques. Discussed again as previously noted in my notes discussed the medications for fibromyalgia (antidepressants, anti-anxiety medications, muscle relaxers, nerve medications) which can be given by her PCP. Emphasized importance of controlling anxiety as key to managing fibromyalgia symptoms.

Sclera erythematous
Unclear of etiology. Patient was given medications to treat, as she was told it was conjunctivitis by the ER, but she has not noticed any improvement. The patient has no issues with her vision. She states her vision is clear, but her right eye is more erythematous than her left. I will give her a referral to ophthalmology to have her eyes be evaluated.

PLAN:
Discontinue hydroxychloroquine as there was no difference of being on it or off of it.
I have requested that patient call the aqua therapy facility as she was given the information on her last visit. She states she will.
Discussed use of multivitamin and magnesium supplementation, which patient states she will try.
Emphasize the importance of continuing anxiety management with her primary care physician.

Return to clinic in six weeks.

Mm-hmm. Hi, I'm going to go. Hi, I'm going to go. I'm going to check up. How's it going? How's it going? What's your name? Sarah. Okay. And what's your name? Rubikish. Okay. Okay. I don't know. I'm going to be able to be. I don't know. Thank you. Okay, do you want me get the translator? Yes, please, Do you want to say my translator? I'll get to do the doctor? You want to be a doctor? Oh, that's a good. I want to be a doctor. Yeah, sure? I want to be here. No, no, no, no, no. Of adults. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Very good. Wow Wow I like that I don't know how much. Okay. Hi, thank you for calling Language Line Solutions. I'm Oscar ID 427.279. How will we at a Spanish interpreter today? I'm proud to serve. you this call my monitor for training quality assurance is your patient with you yep just give me one second I'll give it to her all right all right so when we're all right so when we all right so when we repeat We did the urine last time. It was all clean. It was all negative. So nothing of concern. So it was a normal test. Well, we did she go to, I think I'd given her a script to Aqua Therapy, but she didn't try it yet? Okay. Was that for Aipa Therapy? Okay, but she has the number and everything, correct. But you have the number and everything, correct? Yes. I have said that I'm coming on more. What I have been doing is that I've been walking more. You've been walking more. Okay. That is fine. We stopped the hydroxychloroquine, yes? was there any difference from stopping it and being on it? Okay. So then there's no point of being on the medication. Like I said, you know, it doesn't help with fibromyalgia, but some patients have said in the past, for them it did. But there's no point of taking it if it's not helping. Obviously, that sort of rules out lupus, you know, they're doing it. But, yeah, for you to continue to take it? No, no point in to continue to mending. So, the one is that we've discarded the lupus. Let's see, what else would I want to ask you? Yeah, go ahead. Something that I wanted to let you know, it's been weeks already that I have been with the eye infected. I mean, it hasn't been gone. This has been done. I feel my eye very dry and also my mouth to the point that I have, the whole day I cough. I see. Does she have, so I was going to ask her about her eye because at least her right eye looks slightly red. Does she, did she go to an eye doctor? Just to me to ask her, because if I'm a red, this area, you have seen a optomologist? No, I went to an emergency, a young cancer. My serum, me said that was a conjunctivitis. Me put an antibiotic. You have seen an ophthalmologist? No, I went to an emergency, a genital. Me said, they were a conjunctivitis. Me put an antibiotic. No, I went to the emergency room. They told me they went to the emergency room. They told me there was congenitalitis, and at the end they just gave me some antibiotics in drops, the eye drops, and I've been wearing them or using them, but it's been already two weeks and this doesn't go away. I think that's why it might be important to then see an eye doctor. Okay. because you know we want to make sure typically conjunctuitis if it is truly there should have been some improvement you know with the with the medication but if it's not improving then I then we have to make sure it's nothing else that's going on I I can give her a referral if she wants and then And, you know, she just has to find an eye doctor, you know, to call and make an appointment. Yes, definitely in this case, you have to see a segment with an ophthalmolo, because if it had been a conjunctivitis and it would have been a better with the treatment that they'd have done. So, so I'm going to send you, in this case, for that in this case you have just to call to the doctor and to take a second. but still it's still it's like so I want to let me want to referio if you want to you want to you need to get in this case you have to get a Is there a vision being affected or anything like that or anything like that or no. Diggins, say, do you know. No, me molest, much, me pica, but no. No, it bothersesta, much, me pica, but no. No, it bothers me a lot. It's itchy, but no. Okay. And when it's time to sleep, whenever I want to sleep, it bothers me because I feel like the eye hurts, like if it's dry. All right, only the right eye. Only the right eye. Okay, all right. Take it. Yes. I don't have any of the time. Is that? Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay, so I I have given, I put in a referral for the eye. You just, when you check out, they'll give you the script, and then you just have to call an eye doctor. All right? Do you have an eye doctor in general or no? No. No. When you go out, you're going to give the guide to you can't with this to get your seat with the Oftatmorrow. You've got one that's going to... No. No, I've gone... No, no, I mean, the only places that I have been to it, that's normal, that's it. Okay, all right. All right, so if I, you know, see who is within the insurance in network, and then, you know, have them, and then you could tell them, you know, based on what I've written on the referral, you know have them and then you could tell them you know based on what I've written on the on the referral you know why we need but this has to be checked. If it's not gone, because it hasn't improved, we definitely have to have it be evaluated by an eye doctor. Okay. All right? Revise, then, the doctors that are in their assurator, in the network of the health, of course, and tell me to that doctor what of his eye. Not in the way, everything will be put in the preferred, that I'm going to leave, but definitely, have to revise to that. And this has been been seen by an ophthalmologist that's the doctor of the eyes. So it's that not a better. in the preferred that I'm going to have left. But definitely have to revise to this. And this have been to be used for a ophthalmologist that's the doctor of the eyes. So it's that's not a better. Has there been in terms of in the past, has there been issues with the eye like this type of problems with the eye? Or this is the first time? I've done with a TV, but with the goat in four days to make it. Yes. Thank you. I mean, I have had conjunctivitis, but with the drops three, four days, it goes away. It goes away? Okay. Okay. All right. She's not allergic to anything, is she? Okay. So far, no, okay. So far. No, okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. So, grandma, let it. Okay. Oh, okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. I don't know I don't know I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to I don't know. Okay. Okay. Okay. I don't know my op. Oh, my op. Oh, Anything new medically since I last saw her, other than the eye? Oh, anything medically new since I last saw her? Thank you. Tell me, a medical new from the ultimate scale. No. Okay. And in terms of, I think last time we had talked about using magnesium to relax muscles. Has she tried that? No. Okay. All right, but my question would be, any kind of magnesium, because there is nitrata, or I don't know. All right, but my question would be, any kind of magnesium, because there is side trade, all right, there is, well. Yeah, any type of magnesium. If she has not tried it, it could with you know relaxing the muscles you know that You know, that's what I was just wondering. Yeah, any type of magnesium, I'll help me to relax the muscles. All right. Let me examine her. I'm going to assimil. Hmm. Okay, look, look at that are this? No. Deep breathed enough. Deep breathed, you know? Again. We're doing more than they saw there. Amen. Small reading. Small reading. Small reading. I'm going to be. I don't know. I'm going to be. Okay. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Look to the right. Look to the right. Yeah. I mean, I see mostly on this side, maybe a little on this side, it's always questionable. If it could be allergy, but I don't know. No one around her was sick, right like that, listen. Okay, if I'm on this side, it's a little questionable, if it's an allergic or no. No, no-no. No, no. All right. So, plan will be, first, the eye, make sure that she, you know, she goes to an eye doctor, number one. Number two, after the eye is evaluated and taken care of, try the aqua therapy, right? And then three, obviously, we'll stop to hydroxychloroquine because there's no point of taking it as there's nothing going on from a rheumatological sense as of now. And then try, see any magnesium to see if it helps relax the muscles. The other thing, remember, because I forget, you have anxiety, yes? So make sure you talk to your primary care about that, right? Okay. All right. Any questions? Oh, yeah, go ahead. Sorry, my son. Yes, yes. Well, the first, of the eye, is the thing of the eyes, that we have an ophthalmolo, of course. definitely. Well, if first, of the eyes, that the of an ophthalmolo, definitely, well, if it has to the ophthalmolo to be able to be able to be able to get the aquaterapia for favor then then let's take the hydroxychloricina the hydrochloroquine excuse me okay because of the final no put to take it yeah that no it's a good to do it from from a sense of reumatology no there's point in to take this okay and yeah the next to be a doctor primary and I remember to mention about the thing of the anxiety apart of to take the magnesium that we so low and then ideally like I want if there was nothing wrong at least you know as now I would have said there's no need for her to see a rheumatologist like me because she would be just wasting her money but because of her eye I just want to make sure that everything is okay from that perspective so I'll probably see her back one more time I'm thinking maybe in about six weeks or so, I think six seven weeks, I think that should be good enough time to see an eye doctor. Okay, right. Well, ideally, of course, it would have to be more a rheumatologist if it's that no, because it would just be a money, but we'd to see the ophthalmologist. I think we'll make a set of segment for in three six months, sufficient time for that you can be able to the doctor of So. Okay. That's right. Perfect. Okay. Any questions? Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Um, any questions? Okay. Um, any questions? So I will see her back, like I said, in about, in about six weeks. All right. And so just make sure that she calls the eye doctor or finds the eye doctor and calls them today, right? Aseure to find a doctor in the eyes for you. Okay. All right. All right. All right. So she is all set, right? Mm-hmm. Thank you so much. All right. Thank you so much for your home. Oh, you're welcome. So I thank you for your service. Have a great day all right Okay. Oh, okay. Oh. Okay. Oh. Let me see. I'm sorry. I'm going to get this. Oh. Oh. I'm going to get a camera. No. Okay. Okay. Let's go. I'm going to go ahead. I'm going to recogel this, but I'm going to pick a little bit. So. So. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. That's right. All right, no problem, all right. So just make sure you call the eye doctor, all right? And have them take a look at that. And see you in six weeks, yeah. In six weeks, yes. Thank you. All right. I'm careful. No. Bye.

I'm proud to serve. you this call my monitor for training quality assurance is your patient with you yep just give me one second I'll give it to her all right all right so when we're all right so when we all right so when we repeat We did the urine last time. It was all clean. It was all negative. So nothing of concern. So it was a normal test. Well, we did she go to, I think I'd given her a script to Aqua Therapy, but she didn't try it yet? Okay. Was that for Aipa Therapy? Okay, but she has the number and everything, correct. But you have the number and everything, correct? Yes. I have said that I'm coming on more. What I have been doing is that I've been walking more. You've been walking more. Okay. That is fine. We stopped the hydroxychloroquine, yes? was there any difference from stopping it and being on it? Okay. So then there's no point of being on the medication. Like I said, you know, it doesn't help with fibromyalgia, but some patients have said in the past, for them it did. But there's no point of taking it if it's not helping. Obviously, that sort of rules out lupus, you know, they're doing it. But, yeah, for you to continue to take it? No, no point in to continue to mending. So, the one is that we've discarded the lupus. Let's see, what else would I want to ask you? Yeah, go ahead. Something that I wanted to let you know, it's been weeks already that I have been with the eye infected. I mean, it hasn't been gone. This has been done. I feel my eye very dry and also my mouth to the point that I have, the whole day I cough. I see. Does she have, so I was going to ask her about her eye because at least her right eye looks slightly red. Does she, did she go to an eye doctor? Just to me to ask her, because if I'm a red, this area, you have seen a optomologist? No, I went to an emergency, a young cancer. My serum, me said that was a conjunctivitis. Me put an antibiotic. You have seen an ophthalmologist? No, I went to an emergency, a genital. Me said, they were a conjunctivitis. Me put an antibiotic. No, I went to the emergency room. They told me they went to the emergency room. They told me there was congenitalitis, and at the end they just gave me some antibiotics in drops, the eye drops, and I've been wearing them or using them, but it's been already two weeks and this doesn't go away. I think that's why it might be important to then see an eye doctor. Okay. because you know we want to make sure typically conjunctuitis if it is truly there should have been some improvement you know with the with the medication but if it's not improving then I then we have to make sure it's nothing else that's going on I I can give her a referral if she wants and then And, you know, she just has to find an eye doctor, you know, to call and make an appointment. Yes, definitely in this case, you have to see a segment with an ophthalmolo, because if it had been a conjunctivitis and it would have been a better with the treatment that they'd have done. So, so I'm going to send you, in this case, for that in this case you have just to call to the doctor and to take a second. but still it's still it's like so I want to let me want to referio if you want to you want to you need to get in this case you have to get a Is there a vision being affected or anything like that or anything like that or no. Diggins, say, do you know. No, me molest, much, me pica, but no. No, it bothersesta, much, me pica, but no. No, it bothers me a lot. It's itchy, but no. Okay. And when it's time to sleep, whenever I want to sleep, it bothers me because I feel like the eye hurts, like if it's dry. All right, only the right eye. Only the right eye. Okay, all right. Take it. Yes. I don't have any of the time. Is that? Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay, so I I have given, I put in a referral for the eye. You just, when you check out, they'll give you the script, and then you just have to call an eye doctor. All right? Do you have an eye doctor in general or no? No. No. When you go out, you're going to give the guide to you can't with this to get your seat with the Oftatmorrow. You've got one that's going to... No. No, I've gone... No, no, I mean, the only places that I have been to it, that's normal, that's it. Okay, all right. All right, so if I, you know, see who is within the insurance in network, and then, you know, have them, and then you could tell them, you know, based on what I've written on the referral, you know have them and then you could tell them you know based on what I've written on the on the referral you know why we need but this has to be checked. If it's not gone, because it hasn't improved, we definitely have to have it be evaluated by an eye doctor. Okay. All right? Revise, then, the doctors that are in their assurator, in the network of the health, of course, and tell me to that doctor what of his eye. Not in the way, everything will be put in the preferred, that I'm going to leave, but definitely, have to revise to that. And this has been been seen by an ophthalmologist that's the doctor of the eyes. So it's that not a better. in the preferred that I'm going to have left. But definitely have to revise to this. And this have been to be used for a ophthalmologist that's the doctor of the eyes. So it's that's not a better. Has there been in terms of in the past, has there been issues with the eye like this type of problems with the eye? Or this is the first time? I've done with a TV, but with the goat in four days to make it. Yes. Thank you. I mean, I have had conjunctivitis, but with the drops three, four days, it goes away. It goes away? Okay. Okay. All right. She's not allergic to anything, is she? Okay. So far, no, okay. So far. No, okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. So, grandma, let it. Okay. Oh, okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. I don't know I don't know I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to I don't know. Okay. Okay. Okay. I don't know my op. Oh, my op. Oh, Anything new medically since I last saw her, other than the eye? Oh, anything medically new since I last saw her? Thank you. Tell me, a medical new from the ultimate scale. No. Okay. And in terms of, I think last time we had talked about using magnesium to relax muscles. Has she tried that? No. Okay. All right, but my question would be, any kind of magnesium, because there is nitrata, or I don't know. All right, but my question would be, any kind of magnesium, because there is side trade, all right, there is, well. Yeah, any type of magnesium. If she has not tried it, it could with you know relaxing the muscles you know that You know, that's what I was just wondering. Yeah, any type of magnesium, I'll help me to relax the muscles. All right. Let me examine her. I'm going to assimil. Hmm. Okay, look, look at that are this? No. Deep breathed enough. Deep breathed, you know? Again. We're doing more than they saw there. Amen. Small reading. Small reading. Small reading. I'm going to be. I don't know. I'm going to be. Okay. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Look to the right. Look to the right. Yeah. I mean, I see mostly on this side, maybe a little on this side, it's always questionable. If it could be allergy, but I don't know. No one around her was sick, right like that, listen. Okay, if I'm on this side, it's a little questionable, if it's an allergic or no. No, no-no. No, no. All right. So, plan will be, first, the eye, make sure that she, you know, she goes to an eye doctor, number one. Number two, after the eye is evaluated and taken care of, try the aqua therapy, right? And then three, obviously, we'll stop to hydroxychloroquine because there's no point of taking it as there's nothing going on from a rheumatological sense as of now. And then try, see any magnesium to see if it helps relax the muscles. The other thing, remember, because I forget, you have anxiety, yes? So make sure you talk to your primary care about that, right? Okay. All right. Any questions? Oh, yeah, go ahead. Sorry, my son. Yes, yes. Well, the first, of the eye, is the thing of the eyes, that we have an ophthalmolo, of course. definitely. Well, if first, of the eyes, that the of an ophthalmolo, definitely, well, if it has to the ophthalmolo to be able to be able to be able to get the aquaterapia for favor then then let's take the hydroxychloricina the hydrochloroquine excuse me okay because of the final no put to take it yeah that no it's a good to do it from from a sense of reumatology no there's point in to take this okay and yeah the next to be a doctor primary and I remember to mention about the thing of the anxiety apart of to take the magnesium that we so low and then ideally like I want if there was nothing wrong at least you know as now I would have said there's no need for her to see a rheumatologist like me because she would be just wasting her money but because of her eye I just want to make sure that everything is okay from that perspective so I'll probably see her back one more time I'm thinking maybe in about six weeks or so, I think six seven weeks, I think that should be good enough time to see an eye doctor. Okay, right. Well, ideally, of course, it would have to be more a rheumatologist if it's that no, because it would just be a money, but we'd to see the ophthalmologist. I think we'll make a set of segment for in three six months, sufficient time for that you can be able to the doctor of So. Okay. That's right. Perfect. Okay. Any questions? Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Um, any questions? Okay. Um, any questions? So I will see her back, like I said, in about, in about six weeks. All right. And so just make sure that she calls the eye doctor or finds the eye doctor and calls them today, right? Aseure to find a doctor in the eyes for you. Okay. All right. All right. All right. So she is all set, right? Mm-hmm. Thank you so much. All right. Thank you so much for your home. Oh, you're welcome. So I thank you for your service. Have a great day all right Okay. Oh, okay. Oh. Okay. Oh. Let me see. I'm sorry. I'm going to get this. Oh. Oh. I'm going to get a camera. No. Okay. Okay. Let's go. I'm going to go ahead. I'm going to recogel this, but I'm going to pick a little bit. So. So. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. That's right. All right, no problem, all right. So just make sure you call the eye doctor, all right? And have them take a look at that. And see you in six weeks, yeah. In six weeks, yes. Thank you. All right. I'm careful. No. Bye. All right, see you. I don't know. So, I'm going to I'm doing. I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to I'm here. I'm going to do. I'm going to I'm going to be. I don't know. I don't know.

Evaluation and management of pancreatic cancer

DISEASE HISTORY:
73-year-old woman.
8/31/23: Underwent a CT which revealed a moderate right pleural effusion, mild intra/extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation, and an abnormal pancreatic duct dilatation. A mass was noted in the body/neck of the pancreas causing narrowing of the splenic vein. Celiac and SMA were patent.
9/20/23: Underwent an MRI. She also had a negative EGD and colon. She ultimately saw Dr. Korman and had an EUS. Biopsy of the pancreas revealed fragments consistent with pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
10/23: Began FOLFIRINOX. Significant issues with fatigue, cytopenias, and diarrhea.
2/24: Scan with stable disease. Marker went to normal.
3/14/24: Had distal pancreatectomy/splenectomy and splenic artery excision with Dr. Eskander. Path showed extensive disease; R2 resection, positive margin, T4 disease with disease involving celiac axis. Nodes negative.
4/24: Wound infection.
5/24: Readmitted. CA 199 had risen slightly. Admitted for severe abdominal pain controlled with narcotics.
6/17/24: Initiated gem/abraxane.
7/10/24: Adm after cycle 1 with dehydration and failure to thrive

INTERVAL HISTORY:
07/02/25: Patient presents for follow-up after recent hospitalization for severe fatigue and low blood pressure. Patient was admitted on 06/22/25 with extreme fatigue and inability to function. Three weeks prior to admission, patient experienced chest pains which were initially attributed to indigestion. Prior to admission, patient had dental extraction with subsequent profuse oral bleeding, likely contributing to anemia. During hospitalization, hemoglobin dropped to 7.7, prompting evaluation for bleeding sources. Cardiac evaluation revealed positive cardiac enzymes consistent with myocardial infarction. Cardiac catheterization revealed 100% blockage requiring stent placement on 06/27/25. Patient received blood transfusion and IV iron. Hemoglobin improved to 9.6 at discharge. CA 19-9 was 108 in hospital (down from 150 previously). CT scan during hospitalization showed no new pancreatic disease, only some colonic inflammation unrelated to cancer. Patient reports improved energy since discharge, especially when sitting, though still experiences fatigue attributed to chemotherapy. Constipation remains an ongoing issue managed with Miralax. Lower extremity edema has significantly improved since hospitalization. Currently on Plavix in addition to aspirin following cardiac stent placement.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
The ROS is negative in 12 point detail except for the pertinent positives and negatives listed in HPI and below

OBJECTIVE:
Physical Examination:
Gen: Well developed well nourished. HEENT:PERRLA,EOMI, sclera anicteric, oropharynx clear. Nodes: No peripheral adenopathy. Chest: Clear bilaterally. Heart: S1 S2 no murmurs, regular heartbeat. Abd: Soft, +BS, non tender and non distended, no masses, no organomegaly. Ext: No edema. Skin: no rash. Neuro: motor and sensory grossly intact. Musculoskeletal: Normal gait.

IMPRESSION:
Pancreatic adenocarcinoma: Patient currently on gemcitabine (abraxane discontinued due to intolerance). Recent hospitalization for severe fatigue and low blood pressure. CA 19-9 decreased from 150 to 108 during hospitalization, awaiting most recent value. Recent CT scan during hospitalization showed no new pancreatic disease or progression. Maintaining preventive chemotherapy approach given absence of detectable disease on imaging. Patient tolerating current regimen well with dose reduction to prevent hematologic toxicity.
Recent myocardial infarction: Required cardiac stent placement on 06/27/25 for 100% blockage. Cardiac symptoms likely exacerbated by anemia and bleeding. Now on dual antiplatelet therapy with Plavix and Eliquis. Will monitor blood counts closely given increased bleeding risk with dual anticoagulation.
Iron deficiency anemia secondary to dental bleeding: Received blood transfusion and IV iron during recent hospitalization. Hemoglobin improved from 7.9 to 9.6 at discharge. Iron studies show improvement with iron 59 (was 21), saturation 20% (was 8%), ferritin elevated likely due to recent transfusion and iron infusion. Will monitor iron studies in 1 month and provide additional IV iron as needed.
Bilateral pleural effusions: Previously drained with significant symptomatic improvement. Likely related to fluid overload from chemotherapy and home hydration, now resolved.
Lower extremity edema: Markedly improved following pleural fluid drainage, diuretic therapy, and gemcitabine dose reduction. Current examination shows no edema, suggesting appropriate dose adjustment.
Chronic constipation: Managing with Miralax. Patient modifies timing based on daily activities to avoid inconvenience.
Recent dental extraction with significant oral bleeding: Likely contributed to anemia and dark stools noted during hospitalization.

PLAN:
Continue gemcitabine at current reduced dose as patient is tolerating well with improved lower extremity edema.
Monitor CBC closely due to dual antiplatelet therapy (Eliquis and Plavix) increasing bleeding risk.
Continue home hydration as arranged with Qualitas pharmacy.
Monitor iron studies in one month to assess need for additional IV iron.
Continue to monitor CA 19-9 trends.
Refilled morphine ER 60mg tablets.
Continue Miralax PRN for constipation management.
Coordinate care with cardiology for ongoing cardiac management post-stent placement.
Follow up in person in August.

",," I have a little more energy than I had had. And they, wait, did you, did you go to the hospital short of breath? Because that's what they told me. I don't think I would, I wasn't short of breath as much as I was short of energy. I could barely move, function. Your fatigue, your blood pressure was very low. Yes. And, um, I was sleeping a lot, sleeping a lot. And lot and i just i i couldn't move and um And I said to Greg, I think I want to go to the hospital. I can't function this way. Okay. So that's why I'm curious how you said it. So you were just exhausted. You didn't notice any windedness, anything like that. At that time, I had no chest pains. I didn't have any symptoms of what you would associate a heart ailment to be with? I think when you got there, because the way ERs think they're so like track. like this is this this is this when I saw the records I think they treated you like they thought it could be like a blood clot like a lung issue which is interesting because you didn't feel so short of breath no no I would just could you have an incident a week before we had pains in your arms? Three weeks before. Yes, I did have, I did have chest pains three weeks before. I just thought oh well you know it's indigestion or something like that and i just was trying to find a comfortable position to sit or to lay and but thinking it was something that i ate right everything always related to something you eat right but when you went to the hospital and it was i think it was june 22nd 23rd i'm. The first thing they did, I think, from the ER, I think they started scanning you looking for blood clots, looking for this, looking for that. And then, and then I talked to Dr. Altman later, and he was like, you know, she doesn't have that. And I was actually really relieved with that. I was like, oh, good. Yeah, thank goodness. Yeah. So, and that's when they decided to do the catheterization to see what, he said, the only way we'll know is to go in and see what's going on. Her chemoble, it also dropped. Yeah. How low did it go? I'm looking at it. what he said the only way we'll know is to go in and see what's going on. Her chemo called but also dropped. Yeah. How low did it go? I'm looking at up right now. Below 7.7? Yeah, it did go a little low, or I should say lower than you had been with us in the office, et cetera. Yeah. But she wasn't maintaining a level. But you hadn't gotten transfusions. Not at that time. No, but in the hospital she did. Yes. Right. No, no, no. But I'm saying like in the office... And then did you, when the hemoglobin, so I know they looked for blood clots, they looked for bleeding because the hemoglobin was lower and the blood pressure was lower. I thought I saw something in your chart that you had commented on Dark Stool. Did you, what happened with that part just before I forget because I mean I understand cardiac was the big thing but I want to make sure I didn't miss anything that was a big thing, the dark stool. I had had two teeth removed. And I came home from that and I said, boy, this is going too well. I said to Greg. I said, I have no problems. This is working wonderfully. That was on a Tuesday. Right. And then Thursday, I started bleeding profusely. Huge blood clots, huge. In your mouth? In my mouth. So much so. I blood clots, huge. In your mouth? In my mouth. So much so... I had gone through two boxes of Kleenex getting the gunk out of my mouth. And was that right before the hospital admission? Yes. Oh, so maybe the dark stool was swallowed blood from... Right, that's what we try to convey to the doctors that she ingested all this blood. That's why the stool was black, dark. Right. They weren't buying it. They weren't buying that story. Right. All right. So that's why the stool was black, dark. Right. They weren't buying it. They weren't buying that story. Right. All right. So that's why they started looking for something where she could be bleeding from okay okay that makes sense to me and then and then of course cardiology got involved yes and and then you ultimately went home did you go home just before this weekend I went home on Sunday and they did this stent on June 27th the cardiac stand whichent, which was Friday, right? Yeah. And, um, And in the hospital, I think you got two units of blood. Did they give you ivy iron? Yes, one unit of that and one blood, one blood, right? Just one big. Yeah, one blood. Okay. And, you know, I'm just thinking, I think. Yeah. Was it, I mean, the cardiologist notes, I mean, I'm curious what was in their brain, did they think that, you know, part of the stress to your heart was the, you were bleeding and then your heart couldn't. handle having to function at a lower hemoglobin. So maybe you, you know, like I know there was a blockage which they, because they said that you, you had positive cardiac enzymes, which technically says that you had a myocardial infarction, which is why they put the stent in last Friday. And then when you, the changes that when you went home, yes, you had gotten blood, yes, you had gotten IV iron. Yes, you had gotten the stent, but had gotten ivy iron. Yes, you had gotten the stent, but they also put you on plavics in addition to the elk. because you were already on, right? Yes. Okay. And then when you went home, let me see if I have your last blood count. I do. Your blood count on Sunday was 9.6. So you definitely had come up. Yeah, good. Okay. Because when you came in, I think you were like 7.9. Okay. So that was good. And then how do you feel? That's the question i have i feel i feel better i I feel good sitting down. The energy level is not as low as it had been, but it's still as low. But I also attribute that to chemotherapy. So I don't expect great changes. But I do see some changes. And I'm trying. I'm trying really hard to be more functioning, moving more. I'm walking up and down stairs. I'm trying to. And so I went out yesterday for a short time. I'm doing more. And that was my goal. That's what I hope to accomplish. So you feel a little better since the stent and since the blood transfusions. So maybe the higher level of hemoglobin, maybe them opening the stent, maybe the combination is making you feel more like yourself. The other thing of note, which I I think is helpful is I had the infusion of iron. And I'd like to ask you if you could prescribe that in the future. Right. So we will give iron as long as you were in the office yesterday, which when I called you yesterday, I didn't realize, did you see a provider yesterday or were you just getting blood work? No, I had chemo yesterday. They did do labs. Oh, you saw, um, I, um, out of BC. Yes. Is that her name, Atabesi? I thought so. Am I wrong? I don't know. Whatever it is, I can't pronounce. She's lovely. She joined us. It's, let me look. No, it's Atabisi. I'm not losing my mind. It's lovely. She's, she really, I like, she joined us. She joined us in the winter, and she's not nude oncology. She's new to us. And she's's been a great addition i'm hoping she stays a long time me too and i'm glad she's mine yeah no no no so she's good so So I didn't realize that they gave you chemotherapy yesterday. I knew that they were, I knew you were being seen yesterday. So she did iron studies yesterday. So this is the thing with iron. It might be good. And then if you bleed again, you might need more iron. So the iron studies yesterday were normal, but I want to tell you, they were just normal. So the normal range is like 20 to 40. 45 for the saturation. That's one of the few tests we do. And yours was 20. The iron is supposed to be 37 to 145. You are 51. So you can see with everything you were like on the edge. The ferretin was high, but that's sometimes a measure of inflammation or maybe sometimes right after an iron infusion, we see some rebound up. What's ferretin? Ferritin is one of the iron tests. inflammation, or maybe sometimes right after an iron infusion, we see some rebound up. What's ferretin? Ferritin is one of the iron tests. The four iron tests we do. Ferridin sometimes can be the most reliable, but ferretin can go up after sometimes I see it go a little bit high after iron infusions, even though the person's not iron overloaded, but the other thing that really makes ferritin go up is transfusions. So we're going to have to follow this. So your numbers technically now look like they repleted you, but I would check it in about a month to see. The other thing is, I know you know this, the tumor marker we've been watching I know you and I speak. It was high last time. Now, they did do a CAT scan of you in the hospital, and that CAT scan did not show anything new with the pancreas or anything else in the area. There was just some inflammation in the colon, which I don't think is directly related to the cancer. So, you know, and the other thing is the tumor marker sometimes is elevated if there's inflammation in the area or even if there's stress so i actually I don't know if she sent it yesterday because the last one that I have I think was almost a month ago so if she didn't send it yesterday I'd like to add it to the labs excuse me let me just look at her orders from yesterday okay because if not I'm going to add it sometimes takes a little bit longer to come back she ordered. So it's just not back. Okay. I saw that they did it in the hospital. I saw a number. Okay. I want to say it was like 96 or something. Right, which was already coming down. Right. I thought I saw that too. Hold on. Let me see if I can find, let me see if I could find it in real time for you. Because it was 150 in the office that one time, which was not in keeping where it had been. Yes. And so I wasn't sure. I said, okay, let's see what to make of that. but hold on, let me see if I can find. They did it just once in the hospital. Correct. yes and so I wasn't sure I said okay let's see what to make of that but hold on let me see if I can find they did it just once in the hospital correct And I saw it, and I don't want to tell you the wrong number, but I'll look for it again. Yeah, I keep in, you find things that you're not looking for. Like, I saw all the cardiac enzymes already, but they keep coming up when I'm looking for your labs. And they had you on Hepron a little bit, and they were checking your glucose, all the things I'm not really interested in. And the answer, lots of glucose checks. They check to see if you're breaking down red cells, your blood counts again, because they, oh, wait, here, here, here, I think I'm getting very close. By the way, your iron studies to compare, just because it's coming by my screen, so the iron, which is now 59, which is normal, was 21 21 in the hospital which suggests you really had lost blood and um the saturation, which is 20 now, was 8 in the hospital. So it really was, everything really was very low. Okay. And the CA-199 was, it was 108 in the hospital. So it had already come down from 150. And so's see tomorrow yesterday i'm sorry if it was lower okay well that that's i like that now yeah it's already coming down. So we'll see. So, you know, yes, you had a scan. We're still not seeing anything. As long as you're tolerating this. Now, I think the question is, like, do we think the gymsitabine is causing this? And the answer is, I would say it's much less likely. It's not a drug that we ever see this kind of thing with, so I don't have a high suspicion of that. Are you talking about the blood issue? No, gym, cytobine can drop the blood counts to some extent, but I think your blood loss was mostly due to dental. I was saying I think that the gemcidabine wasn't to blame for the cardiac issue. Okay. Yeah, I have to think that that cardiac issue has been ongoing, has been, it didn't start, it didn't start last week. But I think it might have gotten worse because your blood counts dropped. Okay. So I think it was honestly like the perfect story. storm that i agree a hundred percent yeah so so you know when he called me when dr alman called me he was kind of asking like you know do i not think that he should do something and i was like no no no i definitely want you to do something so that's why i was you know um insistent on all that so that's what i was. I learned little pieces here and there. Okay. So you're on the gym cytopium, which we've dose reduced so that it's It doesn't hurt your platelets and all that. What else is going on that you want me to know? By the way, I do want to see you in person at some point. I feel much better seeing you sitting there, and I can see that you're okay. But I just, let me look at your vitals. I do like to see you every now and then. So your weight dropped in June and you were in the 160s in May and April. I think the last time I saw you in person might have been May. Okay. So that's why I get, is that true? Hold on, I'm just looking. I don't remember. I don't remember either. You know, one month, blurs into the next. No, I know. I just like to kind of keep an eye on you just because. That must have been in East Brunswick. Let me see I last saw you I last saw you That must have been in East Ponswood. Let me see. I last saw you. I last saw you. Actually, I was a week off. I saw you April 22nd. Okay. So, you know, I'm seeing you on video now. I know you live much closer to East Brunswick. But if we could put you on the calendar for, you know, Talamette is fine with me, but like an in person in August, I do want to make sure I physically see you just in case I'm missing something that I can't see in the screen. Okay. Is that fair? Okay. Yeah. Because I just want to make sure that I know exactly what's going on with you. All right. Okay. Have I not, what haven't I answered? I really wanted to make sure we went over everything. I don't think, I don't think anything. I think everything has been going fine with that exception with that bump in the road yeah how are you doing in terms of not necessarily energy but how are the bowels doing um you know it's always that constipation issue um and i'm trying to keep on top of it i'm doing the mirror lax and that's always a a thing where i don't like to do the mearalax if i'm going out for example so you know, if I have something planned for this afternoon, I won't have done Miralax this morning. kind of thing just because it's it's unpredictable and i don't want to be caught off guard or embarrassed so um how about always a constipation issue okay okay but but no not diarrhea nothing like that no diarrhea no not since you took me off that other chemo. You know, the two we stopped. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But, you know, if we have a problem in the future and we don't think that you're having a lot of neuropathy. We talked about giving that back to you. And that's okay. That's okay. We'll figure something else out. Yeah, no, I know. And if you don't have neuropathy, we might add that drug back as long as your blood counts can tolerate and your energy can tolerate. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. The swelling in our feet have diminished greatly Yeah that's a good thing that's actually especially good because I thought that was due to the gem cytobine and so if it is you know we obviously adjusted the dose in the last few months maybe what we adjusted it to seems appropriate now okay so that's actually that makes me happier because I actually remember that. And when you were sitting now and I'm looking at your arms, it made me think of your left. too and I was like oh we actually discussed was she carrying around extra fluid yeah what you look at your legs oh okay okay okay anything else from either of you. No. Okay. Anything else from either of you? No. I know I'm happy I'm happy the way things are going I realize that I'll never be cured but as long as I'm not feeling sick which I'm not I wish I could have more energy but that's got to come from me as well and I know that I don't have any complaints since she's home she's been wonderful. She's been wonderful. and I know that. I don't have any complaints. Since she's home, she's been wonderful. She's been wonderful. she's been eating. She's doing her right things. Yeah, that's actually great. So I think this cardiac thing had really affected you. Yeah. Well, the stint was 100% black, so. Yeah. Yeah. So you needed it. I guess. Yeah. And we weren't aware of it. It just was a fluke. Yeah, I know. I know. Well, because when Dr. Walton called me, I could tell he was, like, surprised. Yeah. He was like, Um, is Susan Seltz, you're patient? I'm like yes he's like um she said she went to the ER and she has she's ruling in for a myocardial infarction and we want to do a stent and but the church has pancreas cancer so we just want to know are you okay with this and I like gave him the whole story so and when I told him the story he said you know that's what the said, but I didn't necessarily believe it. And I wanted to make sure that, because the chart said, like, she had surgery. you know we followed the marker we keep being worried there's disease but we cannot find any disease so we have her more in preventive chemo and the hopes that it'll keep everything away so he knew it but he wanted to make sure it was true and that he wasn't going to do you harm by taking you to this procedure and I was like no no no I fully support thank you and I thank him for for being cautious he's very diligent and he didn't want to do something which wasn't going to help you yeah so my only thing so i don't think you have a bleeding issue my only thing now that you're on the both the blood thinners, is I do want to make sure we watch that blood count because you'll be more likely to bleed if something is bleeding, it'll bleed more. And you haven't really had anything bleeding, but we just have to keep an eye. We do anyway, because when you come, the one thing we do a lot of is blood counts because chemotherapy affects the blood counts too. Okay. So, okay. Okay. I won't keep you guys. I just wanted to touch base, see you with my own eyes, make sure you were okay, review everything. everything with you, the scans, the tumor markers, the blood work, and make sure that we know what the plan is. Yeah, good, good. And I'm in agreement with that, as is Greg. Okay. We're on part, on board. Okay, and I'll ask on my end for them to make sure that I can see you in person sometime in August. All right. Dr. Horan, we need a refill on morphine. Okay. I could do that. Yeah. I'll do that right now, right? in August. All right. Dr. Horan, we need a refill on morphine. Okay. I could do that. Yeah. I'll do that right now right when to get off. Okay. And just to let you know, because I don't know, I don't know if you hear lots of complaints about people or whatever, but between Sally, Daisy in the Edison office, Abisi. At Abisi? They are just wonderful. They're compassionate, they're caring, they're thorough. Daisy, I said to her yesterday, or the other day, I said, I feel like you're taking care of your mother. And she said, and shouldn't we all be acting like that? Do you know, Daisy? Yes, actually. For a second, I didn't. Yes. She's just amazing. She's so compassionate. Yeah. So no complaints on this end for any of them. Oh, that's awesome. That makes me so happy. And I'm so glad that Sally's back. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, it's a good thing. Yeah, it sure is. So, no complaints. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And all the doctors from your end that sources in the hospital were perfect. Dr. Yao, he's a new guy. Yeah, he's, so he's obviously not new to oncology. He used to be in pharmaceutical companies. He came over to us. He's fantastic. What a nice man. And I almost i maybe i shouldn't shouldn't even admit to this but i almost don't care what your qualifications are if you treat me nicely I'm thrilled no and he's he's like super smart and super diligent like he's like he's like he's not going to let up until he knows everything about every patient so he's great yeah and I agree with that what a nice man yeah he's good no complaint but no oh all it's good and and thanks for meeting with us on a Zoom. This, this works out. Yeah, very well. We have our grandkids coming over today for swim lessons. Aw. No, I wanted to see you. And I, you know, scheduling-wise, it's just they, I sent the message, which maybe they didn't understand. And I especially wanted to see you. So I was, I was grateful that I caught it last night because then I had the ability to say, okay, when am I available? Even when she doesn't want to come in? When can we do telemed? we can do it in the morning, we can do it later on the day. So I felt like I didn't want to come in? When can we do telemed? We can do it in the morning. We can do it later on the day. So I felt like I didn't want to lose you, especially after or hospitalization, I like to know that I've reviewed everything with you and I am like I am up to date with what's going on with you. Yeah. So no, no, no, no. Really appreciate that and I appreciate your care as always. No, no, no, no, no, you know. I love talking to you guys. I'm going to do the morphine now and then I will say I will ask them to get you on my schedule for some time in August. Okay. Are we set up, are we straight on the hydration at home? Yes. some confusion with your staff about apparently when I went into the hospital my prescription expires and you have to call back again so I called to have them renew that prescription yeah no there's a message it says spoke to J in Qualitas pharmacy confirmed new home hydration order was received, patient will be contacted for scheduling later today, and that was from yesterday. Did they contact? you? Yes, they did. Okay, so you're good. Yeah, good. And you know what? And I asked them to call me and let me know that, in fact, this was received, and I didn't get that call. That's okay, as long as you got it. I knew I was talking to you today. So that's why, all right, you know, I'll just let it go and we'll discuss it. Yeah. No, no, no, no, that's fine. Let me just see, so they called you. I just want to see the more, if you know, I want to make sure that I renew the right one. No, no, no, no, that's fine. Let me just see, so they called you. I just want to see the more, if you know, want to make sure that I renew the right one... Um, is it the morphine 100 milligrams per 5ML's oral solution? No. It's a sulfate 60 milligrams. Hold on.

Patient was admitted on 06/22/25 with extreme fatigue and inability to function. Three weeks prior to admission, patient experienced chest pains which were initially attributed to indigestion. Prior to admission, patient had dental extraction with subsequent profuse oral bleeding, likely contributing to anemia. During hospitalization, hemoglobin dropped to 7.7, prompting evaluation for bleeding sources. Cardiac evaluation revealed positive cardiac enzymes consistent with myocardial infarction. Cardiac catheterization revealed 100% blockage requiring stent placement on 06/27/25. Patient received blood transfusion and IV iron. Hemoglobin improved to 9.6 at discharge. CA 19-9 was 108 in hospital (down from 150 previously). CT scan during hospitalization showed no new pancreatic disease, only some colonic inflammation unrelated to cancer. Patient reports improved energy since discharge, especially when sitting, though still experiences fatigue attributed to chemotherapy. Constipation remains an ongoing issue managed with Miralax. Lower extremity edema has significantly improved since hospitalization.

HEENT:PERRLA,EOMI, sclera anicteric, oropharynx clear. Nodes: No peripheral adenopathy. Chest: Clear bilaterally. Heart: S1 S2 no murmurs, regular heartbeat. Abd: Soft, +BS, non tender and non distended, no masses, no organomegaly. Ext: No edema. Skin: no rash. Neuro: motor and sensory grossly intact. Musculoskeletal: Normal gait.\n\nIMPRESSION:\nPancreatic adenocarcinoma: Patient currently on gemcitabine (abraxane discontinued due to intolerance). Recent hospitalization for severe fatigue and low blood pressure. CA 19-9 decreased from 150 to 108 during hospitalization, awaiting most recent value. Recent CT scan during hospitalization showed no new pancreatic disease or progression. Maintaining preventive chemotherapy approach given absence of detectable disease on imaging. Patient tolerating current regimen well with dose reduction to prevent hematologic toxicity.\nRecent myocardial infarction: Required cardiac stent placement on 06/27/25 for 100% blockage. Cardiac symptoms likely exacerbated by anemia and bleeding. Now on dual antiplatelet therapy with Plavix and Eliquis. Will monitor blood counts closely given increased bleeding risk with dual anticoagulation.\nIron deficiency anemia secondary to dental bleeding: Received blood transfusion and IV iron during recent hospitalization. Hemoglobin improved from 7.9 to 9.6 at discharge. Iron studies show improvement with iron 59 (was 21), saturation 20% (was 8%), ferritin elevated likely due to recent transfusion and iron infusion. Will monitor iron studies in 1 month and provide additional IV iron as needed.\nBilateral pleural effusions: Previously drained with significant symptomatic improvement. Likely related to fluid overload from chemotherapy and home hydration, now resolved.\nLower extremity edema: Markedly improved following pleural fluid drainage, diuretic therapy, and gemcitabine dose reduction. Current examination shows no edema, suggesting appropriate dose adjustment.\nChronic constipation: Managing with Miralax. Patient modifies timing based on daily activities to avoid inconvenience.\nRecent dental extraction with significant oral bleeding: Likely contributed to anemia and dark stools noted during hospitalization.\n\nPLAN:\nContinue gemcitabine at current reduced dose as patient is tolerating well with improved lower extremity edema.\nMonitor CBC closely due to dual antiplatelet therapy (Eliquis and Plavix) increasing bleeding risk.\nContinue home hydration as arranged with Qualitas pharmacy.\nMonitor iron studies in one month to assess need for additional IV iron.\nContinue to monitor CA 19-9 trends.\nRefilled morphine ER 60mg tablets.\nContinue Miralax PRN for constipation management.\nCoordinate care with cardiology for ongoing cardiac management post-stent placement.\nFollow up in person in August.\n\nPatient has given prior verbal consent to have the conversation recorded and summarized by the Knowtex software.', 'plan': '1.

And they, wait, did you, did you go to the hospital short of breath? Because that's what they told me. I don't think I would, I wasn't short of breath as much as I was short of energy. I could barely move, function. Your fatigue, your blood pressure was very low. Yes. And, um, I was sleeping a lot, sleeping a lot. And lot and i just i i couldn't move and um And I said to Greg, I think I want to go to the hospital. I can't function this way. Okay. So that's why I'm curious how you said it. So you were just exhausted. You didn't notice any windedness, anything like that. At that time, I had no chest pains. I didn't have any symptoms of what you would associate a heart ailment to be with? I think when you got there, because the way ERs think they're so like track. like this is this this is this when I saw the records I think they treated you like they thought it could be like a blood clot like a lung issue which is interesting because you didn't feel so short of breath no no I would just could you have an incident a week before we had pains in your arms? Three weeks before. Yes, I did have, I did have chest pains three weeks before. I just thought oh well you know it's indigestion or something like that and i just was trying to find a comfortable position to sit or to lay and but thinking it was something that i ate right everything always related to something you eat right but when you went to the hospital and it was i think it was june 22nd 23rd i'm. The first thing they did, I think, from the ER, I think they started scanning you looking for blood clots, looking for this, looking for that. And then, and then I talked to Dr. Altman later, and he was like, you know, she doesn't have that. And I was actually really relieved with that. I was like, oh, good. Yeah, thank goodness. Yeah. So, and that's when they decided to do the catheterization to see what, he said, the only way we'll know is to go in and see what's going on. Her chemoble, it also dropped. Yeah. How low did it go? I'm looking at it. what he said the only way we'll know is to go in and see what's going on. Her chemo called but also dropped. Yeah. How low did it go? I'm looking at up right now. Below 7.7? Yeah, it did go a little low, or I should say lower than you had been with us in the office, et cetera. Yeah. But she wasn't maintaining a level. But you hadn't gotten transfusions. Not at that time. No, but in the hospital she did. Yes. Right. No, no, no. But I'm saying like in the office... And then did you, when the hemoglobin, so I know they looked for blood clots, they looked for bleeding because the hemoglobin was lower and the blood pressure was lower. I thought I saw something in your chart that you had commented on Dark Stool. Did you, what happened with that part just before I forget because I mean I understand cardiac was the big thing but I want to make sure I didn't miss anything that was a big thing, the dark stool. I had had two teeth removed. And I came home from that and I said, boy, this is going too well. I said to Greg. I said, I have no problems. This is working wonderfully. That was on a Tuesday. Right. And then Thursday, I started bleeding profusely. Huge blood clots, huge. In your mouth? In my mouth. So much so. I blood clots, huge. In your mouth? In my mouth. So much so... I had gone through two boxes of Kleenex getting the gunk out of my mouth. And was that right before the hospital admission? Yes. Oh, so maybe the dark stool was swallowed blood from... Right, that's what we try to convey to the doctors that she ingested all this blood. That's why the stool was black, dark. Right. They weren't buying it. They weren't buying that story. Right. All right. So that's why the stool was black, dark. Right. They weren't buying it. They weren't buying that story. Right. All right. So that's why they started looking for something where she could be bleeding from okay okay that makes sense to me and then and then of course cardiology got involved yes and and then you ultimately went home did you go home just before this weekend I went home on Sunday and they did this stent on June 27th the cardiac stand whichent, which was Friday, right? Yeah. And, um, And in the hospital, I think you got two units of blood. Did they give you ivy iron? Yes, one unit of that and one blood, one blood, right? Just one big. Yeah, one blood. Okay. And, you know, I'm just thinking, I think. Yeah. Was it, I mean, the cardiologist notes, I mean, I'm curious what was in their brain, did they think that, you know, part of the stress to your heart was the, you were bleeding and then your heart couldn't. handle having to function at a lower hemoglobin. So maybe you, you know, like I know there was a blockage which they, because they said that you, you had positive cardiac enzymes, which technically says that you had a myocardial infarction, which is why they put the stent in last Friday. And then when you, the changes that when you went home, yes, you had gotten blood, yes, you had gotten IV iron. Yes, you had gotten the stent, but had gotten ivy iron. Yes, you had gotten the stent, but they also put you on plavics in addition to the elk. because you were already on, right? Yes. Okay. And then when you went home, let me see if I have your last blood count. I do. Your blood count on Sunday was 9.6. So you definitely had come up. Yeah, good. Okay. Because when you came in, I think you were like 7.9. Okay. So that was good. And then how do you feel? That's the question i have i feel i feel better i I feel good sitting down. The energy level is not as low as it had been, but it's still as low. But I also attribute that to chemotherapy. So I don't expect great changes. But I do see some changes. And I'm trying. I'm trying really hard to be more functioning, moving more. I'm walking up and down stairs. I'm trying to. And so I went out yesterday for a short time. I'm doing more. And that was my goal. That's what I hope to accomplish. So you feel a little better since the stent and since the blood transfusions. So maybe the higher level of hemoglobin, maybe them opening the stent, maybe the combination is making you feel more like yourself. The other thing of note, which I I think is helpful is I had the infusion of iron. And I'd like to ask you if you could prescribe that in the future. Right. So we will give iron as long as you were in the office yesterday, which when I called you yesterday, I didn't realize, did you see a provider yesterday or were you just getting blood work? No, I had chemo yesterday. They did do labs. Oh, you saw, um, I, um, out of BC. Yes. Is that her name, Atabesi? I thought so. Am I wrong? I don't know. Whatever it is, I can't pronounce. She's lovely. She joined us. It's, let me look. No, it's Atabisi. I'm not losing my mind. It's lovely. She's, she really, I like, she joined us. She joined us in the winter, and she's not nude oncology. She's new to us. And she's's been a great addition i'm hoping she stays a long time me too and i'm glad she's mine yeah no no no so she's good so So I didn't realize that they gave you chemotherapy yesterday. I knew that they were, I knew you were being seen yesterday. So she did iron studies yesterday. So this is the thing with iron. It might be good. And then if you bleed again, you might need more iron. So the iron studies yesterday were normal, but I want to tell you, they were just normal. So the normal range is like 20 to 40. 45 for the saturation. That's one of the few tests we do. And yours was 20. The iron is supposed to be 37 to 145. You are 51. So you can see with everything you were like on the edge. The ferretin was high, but that's sometimes a measure of inflammation or maybe sometimes right after an iron infusion, we see some rebound up. What's ferretin? Ferritin is one of the iron tests. inflammation, or maybe sometimes right after an iron infusion, we see some rebound up. What's ferretin? Ferritin is one of the iron tests. The four iron tests we do. Ferridin sometimes can be the most reliable, but ferretin can go up after sometimes I see it go a little bit high after iron infusions, even though the person's not iron overloaded, but the other thing that really makes ferritin go up is transfusions. So we're going to have to follow this. So your numbers technically now look like they repleted you, but I would check it in about a month to see. The other thing is, I know you know this, the tumor marker we've been watching I know you and I speak. It was high last time. Now, they did do a CAT scan of you in the hospital, and that CAT scan did not show anything new with the pancreas or anything else in the area. There was just some inflammation in the colon, which I don't think is directly related to the cancer. So, you know, and the other thing is the tumor marker sometimes is elevated if there's inflammation in the area or even if there's stress so i actually I don't know if she sent it yesterday because the last one that I have I think was almost a month ago so if she didn't send it yesterday I'd like to add it to the labs excuse me let me just look at her orders from yesterday okay because if not I'm going to add it sometimes takes a little bit longer to come back she ordered. So it's just not back. Okay. I saw that they did it in the hospital. I saw a number. Okay. I want to say it was like 96 or something. Right, which was already coming down. Right. I thought I saw that too. Hold on. Let me see if I can find, let me see if I could find it in real time for you. Because it was 150 in the office that one time, which was not in keeping where it had been. Yes. And so I wasn't sure. I said, okay, let's see what to make of that. but hold on, let me see if I can find. They did it just once in the hospital. Correct. yes and so I wasn't sure I said okay let's see what to make of that but hold on let me see if I can find they did it just once in the hospital correct And I saw it, and I don't want to tell you the wrong number, but I'll look for it again. Yeah, I keep in, you find things that you're not looking for. Like, I saw all the cardiac enzymes already, but they keep coming up when I'm looking for your labs. And they had you on Hepron a little bit, and they were checking your glucose, all the things I'm not really interested in. And the answer, lots of glucose checks. They check to see if you're breaking down red cells, your blood counts again, because they, oh, wait, here, here, here, I think I'm getting very close. By the way, your iron studies to compare, just because it's coming by my screen, so the iron, which is now 59, which is normal, was 21 21 in the hospital which suggests you really had lost blood and um the saturation, which is 20 now, was 8 in the hospital. So it really was, everything really was very low. Okay. And the CA-199 was, it was 108 in the hospital. So it had already come down from 150. And so's see tomorrow yesterday i'm sorry if it was lower okay well that that's i like that now yeah it's already coming down. So we'll see. So, you know, yes, you had a scan. We're still not seeing anything. As long as you're tolerating this. Now, I think the question is, like, do we think the gymsitabine is causing this? And the answer is, I would say it's much less likely. It's not a drug that we ever see this kind of thing with, so I don't have a high suspicion of that. Are you talking about the blood issue? No, gym, cytobine can drop the blood counts to some extent, but I think your blood loss was mostly due to dental. I was saying I think that the gemcidabine wasn't to blame for the cardiac issue. Okay. Yeah, I have to think that that cardiac issue has been ongoing, has been, it didn't start, it didn't start last week. But I think it might have gotten worse because your blood counts dropped. Okay. So I think it was honestly like the perfect story. storm that i agree a hundred percent yeah so so you know when he called me when dr alman called me he was kind of asking like you know do i not think that he should do something and i was like no no no i definitely want you to do something so that's why i was you know um insistent on all that so that's what i was. I learned little pieces here and there. Okay. So you're on the gym cytopium, which we've dose reduced so that it's It doesn't hurt your platelets and all that. What else is going on that you want me to know? By the way, I do want to see you in person at some point. I feel much better seeing you sitting there, and I can see that you're okay. But I just, let me look at your vitals. I do like to see you every now and then. So your weight dropped in June and you were in the 160s in May and April. I think the last time I saw you in person might have been May. Okay. So that's why I get, is that true? Hold on, I'm just looking. I don't remember. I don't remember either. You know, one month, blurs into the next. No, I know. I just like to kind of keep an eye on you just because. That must have been in East Brunswick. Let me see I last saw you I last saw you That must have been in East Ponswood. Let me see. I last saw you. I last saw you. Actually, I was a week off. I saw you April 22nd. Okay. So, you know, I'm seeing you on video now. I know you live much closer to East Brunswick. But if we could put you on the calendar for, you know, Talamette is fine with me, but like an in person in August, I do want to make sure I physically see you just in case I'm missing something that I can't see in the screen. Okay. Is that fair? Okay. Yeah. Because I just want to make sure that I know exactly what's going on with you. All right. Okay. Have I not, what haven't I answered? I really wanted to make sure we went over everything. I don't think, I don't think anything. I think everything has been going fine with that exception with that bump in the road yeah how are you doing in terms of not necessarily energy but how are the bowels doing um you know it's always that constipation issue um and i'm trying to keep on top of it i'm doing the mirror lax and that's always a a thing where i don't like to do the mearalax if i'm going out for example so you know, if I have something planned for this afternoon, I won't have done Miralax this morning. kind of thing just because it's it's unpredictable and i don't want to be caught off guard or embarrassed so um how about always a constipation issue okay okay but but no not diarrhea nothing like that no diarrhea no not since you took me off that other chemo. You know, the two we stopped. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But, you know, if we have a problem in the future and we don't think that you're having a lot of neuropathy. We talked about giving that back to you. And that's okay. That's okay. We'll figure something else out. Yeah, no, I know. And if you don't have neuropathy, we might add that drug back as long as your blood counts can tolerate and your energy can tolerate. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. The swelling in our feet have diminished greatly Yeah that's a good thing that's actually especially good because I thought that was due to the gem cytobine and so if it is you know we obviously adjusted the dose in the last few months maybe what we adjusted it to seems appropriate now okay so that's actually that makes me happier because I actually remember that. And when you were sitting now and I'm looking at your arms, it made me think of your left. too and I was like oh we actually discussed was she carrying around extra fluid yeah what you look at your legs oh okay okay okay anything else from either of you. No. Okay. Anything else from either of you? No. I know I'm happy I'm happy the way things are going I realize that I'll never be cured but as long as I'm not feeling sick which I'm not I wish I could have more energy but that's got to come from me as well and I know that I don't have any complaints since she's home she's been wonderful. She's been wonderful. and I know that. I don't have any complaints. Since she's home, she's been wonderful. She's been wonderful. she's been eating. She's doing her right things. Yeah, that's actually great. So I think this cardiac thing had really affected you. Yeah. Well, the stint was 100% black, so. Yeah. Yeah. So you needed it. I guess. Yeah. And we weren't aware of it. It just was a fluke. Yeah, I know. I know. Well, because when Dr. Walton called me, I could tell he was, like, surprised. Yeah. He was like, Um, is Susan Seltz, you're patient? I'm like yes he's like um she said she went to the ER and she has she's ruling in for a myocardial infarction and we want to do a stent and but the church has pancreas cancer so we just want to know are you okay with this and I like gave him the whole story so and when I told him the story he said you know that's what the said, but I didn't necessarily believe it. And I wanted to make sure that, because the chart said, like, she had surgery. you know we followed the marker we keep being worried there's disease but we cannot find any disease so we have her more in preventive chemo and the hopes that it'll keep everything away so he knew it but he wanted to make sure it was true and that he wasn't going to do you harm by taking you to this procedure and I was like no no no I fully support thank you and I thank him for for being cautious he's very diligent and he didn't want to do something which wasn't going to help you yeah so my only thing so i don't think you have a bleeding issue my only thing now that you're on the both the blood thinners, is I do want to make sure we watch that blood count because you'll be more likely to bleed if something is bleeding, it'll bleed more. And you haven't really had anything bleeding, but we just have to keep an eye. We do anyway, because when you come, the one thing we do a lot of is blood counts because chemotherapy affects the blood counts too. Okay. So, okay. Okay. I won't keep you guys. I just wanted to touch base, see you with my own eyes, make sure you were okay, review everything. everything with you, the scans, the tumor markers, the blood work, and make sure that we know what the plan is. Yeah, good, good. And I'm in agreement with that, as is Greg. Okay. We're on part, on board. Okay, and I'll ask on my end for them to make sure that I can see you in person sometime in August. All right. Dr. Horan, we need a refill on morphine. Okay. I could do that. Yeah. I'll do that right now, right? in August. All right. Dr. Horan, we need a refill on morphine. Okay. I could do that. Yeah. I'll do that right now right when to get off. Okay. And just to let you know, because I don't know, I don't know if you hear lots of complaints about people or whatever, but between Sally, Daisy in the Edison office, Abisi. At Abisi? They are just wonderful. They're compassionate, they're caring, they're thorough. Daisy, I said to her yesterday, or the other day, I said, I feel like you're taking care of your mother. And she said, and shouldn't we all be acting like that? Do you know, Daisy? Yes, actually. For a second, I didn't. Yes. She's just amazing. She's so compassionate. Yeah. So no complaints on this end for any of them. Oh, that's awesome. That makes me so happy. And I'm so glad that Sally's back. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, it's a good thing. Yeah, it sure is. So, no complaints. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And all the doctors from your end that sources in the hospital were perfect. Dr. Yao, he's a new guy. Yeah, he's, so he's obviously not new to oncology. He used to be in pharmaceutical companies. He came over to us. He's fantastic. What a nice man. And I almost i maybe i shouldn't shouldn't even admit to this but i almost don't care what your qualifications are if you treat me nicely I'm thrilled no and he's he's like super smart and super diligent like he's like he's like he's not going to let up until he knows everything about every patient so he's great yeah and I agree with that what a nice man yeah he's good no complaint but no oh all it's good and and thanks for meeting with us on a Zoom. This, this works out. Yeah, very well. We have our grandkids coming over today for swim lessons. Aw. No, I wanted to see you. And I, you know, scheduling-wise, it's just they, I sent the message, which maybe they didn't understand. And I especially wanted to see you. So I was, I was grateful that I caught it last night because then I had the ability to say, okay, when am I available? Even when she doesn't want to come in? When can we do telemed? we can do it in the morning, we can do it later on the day. So I felt like I didn't want to come in? When can we do telemed? We can do it in the morning. We can do it later on the day. So I felt like I didn't want to lose you, especially after or hospitalization, I like to know that I've reviewed everything with you and I am like I am up to date with what's going on with you. Yeah. So no, no, no, no. Really appreciate that and I appreciate your care as always. No, no, no, no, no, you know. I love talking to you guys. I'm going to do the morphine now and then I will say I will ask them to get you on my schedule for some time in August. Okay. Are we set up, are we straight on the hydration at home? Yes. some confusion with your staff about apparently when I went into the hospital my prescription expires and you have to call back again so I called to have them renew that prescription yeah no there's a message it says spoke to J in Qualitas pharmacy confirmed new home hydration order was received, patient will be contacted for scheduling later today, and that was from yesterday. Did they contact? you? Yes, they did. Okay, so you're good. Yeah, good. And you know what? And I asked them to call me and let me know that, in fact, this was received, and I didn't get that call. That's okay, as long as you got it. I knew I was talking to you today. So that's why, all right, you know, I'll just let it go and we'll discuss it. Yeah. No, no, no, no, that's fine. Let me just see, so they called you. I just want to see the more, if you know, I want to make sure that I renew the right one. No, no, no, no, that's fine. Let me just see, so they called you. I just want to see the more, if you know, want to make sure that I renew the right one... Um, is it the morphine 100 milligrams per 5ML's oral solution? No. It's a sulfate 60 milligrams. Hold on. Let me show all. Hold on. I want to make sure I see it. Um, morphine ER 60 milligrams tablet extended release, 90. Yes. Okay. I am refilling that now, but don't leave Yes. Okay. I am refilling that now, but don't leave me just yet. I just want to make sure that I have the right pharmacy? Hold on. Give me a second. Is it going to RX on New Brunswick Avenue? Correct. Okay.

Well, you were right about the shangle shop. We got it in 2015, it was the old one. That was the old one, okay. So should I get the new one? Yeah, oh yeah, that's the recommendation, yes. Okay, here's the other thing. Suppose I have a colonoscopy some time, and is that going to affect it? Well, it's not going to affect the colonoscopy, but you can't, wait as the colonoscopy. I don't know, because I have, I'm having a consultation with the doctor on August 4th. So I think right after that, they'll have, you know, schedule. Oh, you'll have plenty of time for the shot to wear a wrong. I don't say, I think that's me for sometimes, you don't, no, no, this is the end of any vaccine. I don't think there'll be a problem. I mean, look, there's, even since you got the one vaccine in New York, you have some protection from that so i would say if you you know wait if you want to wait until after you're done with the colonoscopy too much that's no big deal oh yeah it's not it's not right but i would just say wait until you get through everything you're doing then you can and okay, I think. Yeah, there you go. All right. And then let's see. So let's take a look at your blood work. So your cholesterol is really good. Bad cholesterol is only 73. And let's see. Jigger is good. Liver and kidney function is good. Blood count was normal. Your intestine is clean. So it's a good report. So nothing to worry about there. Let's see what she got for your vital signs. It's a 124 or 80 on the blood pressures, and you're doing well. there um you've at some point you did a colonoscopy you're in oh yeah that's right that's what you did it do it because they had the pacemaker you have to make a whole year much you're gonna what's in okay what about uh what about your mammogram did you still do those oh yeah so i'm gonna probably that they don't send it they didn't send you a report i go in january they didn't send you anything well they might have let's say it was it was good it was clear so let me uh sometimes they do i just you know that's not always real obvious the way this oh okay oh yeah no they did i got it it just it doesn't it's not the way this is organized it doesn't pop right in my face so i just wonder if they sent it because you were the one that i think it from you because now i go to the uh yeah since i kind of yeah so just just whatever you're getting close to get ready just call me i'll send the also now Now the way we do it here, the order goes right over there electronically anyway. What? Good. I always go in January. That's good. How about the eye doctor? You've been to the eye doctor? Yeah, we went in French. Okay, and everything was good. Okay. The same glasses forever. Okay. So we went through you at the table because they're hearing. Okay. And you feel like the hearing aids are helping? Oh, yeah. I can't. Okay. But I am. I love some hearing what it's fine. You know, you don't leave those in. I just want to look at the eyes. I'd say, oh. Good. There's what my time. Here's something. Yeah, but I mean, you got to do all this. I just, that sounds. I just don't know. They don't think in church, and they didn't expect. And I was thinking about this morning, because I had actually had mine dental checkup this morning. And if you go back in time before there was dentistry, I mean, most people by the time, if they even lived as long as you lived, didn't have teeth. Teeth were gone by them. And so. Yeah. And so. I think they had the money even to go. They're doing this. Well, it sounds crazy. I mean, at least now you can chew. I would think about how different your life would be if you couldn't chew. So doing all these things, I know, I know it takes all takes up time. It does make your life, I don't know. Oh my God, we don't use this way too. Oh, right. You press it in and out. And again, please. There one more. Good. And actually down on the time. table. Hold your breath for a moment. I'm going to listen to your neck. Good. Now you can relax and read normally. I'll listen to your heart. Listen at the bottom. Good. Your heart sounds good. The pincers work. Getting us stopped for suicide. Yes, you can go on up. This is your piece here? Yeah. You put it on me. Yeah, you could join that. I'm going to check your value in my sir. My one leg that's a little small one. I don't know why. You know, we all have, we all have benefit to something. extend as we get older. I think veins just leak a little bit. Like, I mean, I actually first. But it's just that it takes a little swollen. But I have this leg doesn't. Yeah. Well, I have, but I have it too. I don't know. So I have a little bit of swelling in this leg. Um, you know, and I had the hips done in both legs. I don't know why one would be more than the other but they it's just i don't know it is it's the mystery whatever but i mean i can walk around i move you know so like I can't complain too much. All right, now, are you good with your prescriptions? I think, well, I think you have to look to see what I have the four prescriptions. Oh, and the other thing is the, is it am, um, say, amoxys. I know I need that because when I go to the dentist, I have to, you know, pre-medicate myself, so I think. What do you take? You take four amoxicill tablets? Do you want me to send that in now? I don't need, I only need. need eight because um well i don't know yeah eight i'll tell you why because i have four left for for thursday i'll go to the dentist and then i'll need some for next year so if you could get me eight eight of them yeah eight that's okay you took four of them before she she just called me ball out at the shop right she said kameel don't forget to premedicate i'm okay but you do it an hour ahead of time an hour ahead of time yeah yeah and she said you know make sure you don't lie because she was telling me a story about somebody that don't lie yeah yeah she's no don't like i said what i know she said i'm only saying that because somebody we know that they i guess they wound up getting a bad infection and they passed away because they had an infection in their mouth i mean i never had sores or anything wearing but still you probably be fine um you want the cvs over there on rooslay yes please I mean, patients do that all the time, though. I remember this one man I had this a long time ago who was, he came to see me because he was really worried because he was just turning 40, but his father died when he was 40. So we thought they had a heart attack, so he wanted to be checked out. And I said, well, you know, you haven't any symptoms, having any chest? He was no, no, I feel good. I said, all right, EKG was normal. Blood work was okay. Well, there was one little abnormality, but it was a weird thing. And so I... I said, so nothing's bothering, yeah. And so I said, I guess, you know, just come and see me a couple of months and we'll just, I'll just keep checking, see if anything changes. So then, like, just two or three days later, there was a story. There was a baseball player, a professional baseball player who, you know, didn't show up to the ballpark one day. And so they went back and found him dead in his hotel room. And this guy was only like 30, 30, 31, something like that. the story was apparently his father had died early. So I heard that. And I called the guy that my patient back up. I said, listen, you just heard that story? I said, I want you to go and see the cardiologist. I said, I don't know what's going on here, but that scared me too much. That was too coincidental. He goes to the finally, it took me, he procrastinated, but he finally goes and the Cardinal just calls me up. He said, boy, I'm really glad you sent this guy over to see me. And I said, well, why? I said, well, we just put him on, you know, we have him on the treadmill. He goes, it's. It's terrible. I'm taking him straight to the hospital right now. We're going to put a stent in him today. And I said, wow, I'm surprised. Yeah, I said, I'm surprised he wasn't having chest pain. He said, well, guess what? He was lying to you. He was having chest pain all the long. He not only didn't say it, he specifically denied it. I thought he's, he, the funny thing was that the guy goes, yeah, you should see what had to do to keep his wife from checking joking but anyway he he's alive and well today that was at least 20 years ago and he's no he's still alive and well he's well now he follows up with the cardiologist he does everything he's supposed to do and whatever well it can't it can't hurt you know I I tell people people ask me that all the time and I'll say you know if you're not having any symptoms you don't have to do it but I said you know what it's not a bad idea I get another opinion, you know, whatever. You might do a bunch of things that turn out to be, well, you didn't really. need to do them but but you know what but so what if you know your insurance is going to cover it so what's that what the heck and um and if they just tell you how you don't need to come back here for 10 years or something then then you're okay so yeah so i um i i i have a every well ever since then i have a much shorter short a leash for sending people over to the uh to the cardiologist because because that i mean he even asked the cardiologist just or the wife and he said you know what you know if he hadn't come today you know could you know he when when would something bad have happened the guy said you know you can't you can't know that for sure he goes but certainly it would have been within months it would have been and it obviously could have because it took him over a month to make the appointment before he finally got around to make it the appointment so it could have happened in between the time i told him the guy but he said the guy said it certainly would have happened within within sometime within the next few months he could have been the next day could have been you know in three or four months fortunately he got in there they got it done and then like you said he's been he's been good ever since but i mean that was uh that was and why he uh why he why he lied and he gave it was it the trouble of coming here but didn't want to tell me he was having the chest pain because that would have that would have changed everything to what i did i mean i just don't know i mean they told me after i had a chamber the doctor said said to my daughter well she doesn't need her pacemaker and then they called me and then overnight and say get to the hospital immediately oh really said why well you're an aphib i didn't know i didn't have any symptoms well a lot of times you don't i mean you're i was on a monitor oh i said that's how they knew because they said well how do you know they said well your monitor is showing you're an aphib gets in the hospital immediately i called my son i said mark you have to take me to the hospital He goes, maybe she'll believe. I said, no, just get me to the hospital. But they didn't put the pacemaker in until three days. later but they were monitoring me in the hospital. Yeah. And what I'm saying is they said I probably wouldn't need one and then I needed one. Okay. Well, but at least they were, but at least they were doing the monitoring so they could pick it up. So. They said, why? This was at 2.30 in the morning at the focus range. I thought first was a wrong number and I picked it up. Camille, get to the hospital. It's right. All right. Well, anyway, it looks like you're doing okay right now. So I would, oh, I was about to look up medication. So I just took care of the amoxicillin. And then let's see. Okay, so the atorvastatin. You need that refilled? So let's refill that one. If it's too soon, they won't give. Well, they'll just hold it. That's okay. These are microsome. These are microphones. I don't know. Let's take care of the Atorvistan. All right. And you said this is going to Optum. So that's the Atoribistan. And then, let me get back to the list here. Do you still have to take the cinema? What's that? Carbidopa. Lepidopa? No. That's done? No. I went to the, he said not quite. Parkinson's? Thank God for them. That's for sure. Who should go to Dr. Wauserstrom? Yeah. Yeah, no, he just retired. Let's see, that's 40 milligrams. Let's see, that's 40 milligrams. And then... That makes you wait. Yeah, that's it. Come on. I hope that doesn't mean this. I hope that doesn't mean this, the network's about to go down. down. I don't see. I'm sorry. So you got Tumassart and hydrochlorathizide. Now, of course. Okay. And what about Metoprol? Yeah, it's 25 million. You need that one to be filled? I have 50 milligrams. So, oh, so he probably sent the prescripted. Oh, he didn't? Okay. So he wants you to change it to 20 milligrams. 25. So hold on, you got to go up here then. Okay, but you said 25 minutes, okay. And the eloquess, you want Malloway to also, right? It's five. well until they're sure that you're not going to be any of them anymore that takes a lot of okay all right so that's all your prescriptions so you should be good you should be good for those for the for the next 12 months um anything else that you can think of okay i just wanted to tell you about the shingle shop because she said it was the old one and it was in 2015 so once you get done with everything get get get the new one and then uh then you'll be you'll be in good shape okay",fu,"- CPT Code: 99406

Well, you were right about the shangle shop. We got it in 2015, it was the old one. That was the old one, okay. So should I get the new one? Yeah, oh yeah, that's the recommendation, yes. Okay, here's the other thing. Suppose I have a colonoscopy some time, and is that going to affect it? Well, it's not going to affect the colonoscopy, but you can't, wait as the colonoscopy. I don't know, because I have, I'm having a consultation with the doctor on August 4th. So I think right after that, they'll have, you know, schedule. Oh, you'll have plenty of time for the shot to wear a wrong. I don't say, I think that's me for sometimes, you don't, no, no, this is the end of any vaccine. I don't think there'll be a problem. I mean, look, there's, even since you got the one vaccine in New York, you have some protection from that so i would say if you you know wait if you want to wait until after you're done with the colonoscopy too much that's no big deal oh yeah it's not it's not right but i would just say wait until you get through everything you're doing then you can and okay, I think. Yeah, there you go. All right. And then let's see. So let's take a look at your blood work. So your cholesterol is really good. Bad cholesterol is only 73. And let's see. Jigger is good. Liver and kidney function is good. Blood count was normal. Your intestine is clean. So it's a good report. So nothing to worry about there. Let's see what she got for your vital signs. It's a 124 or 80 on the blood pressures, and you're doing well. there um you've at some point you did a colonoscopy you're in oh yeah that's right that's what you did it do it because they had the pacemaker you have to make a whole year much you're gonna what's in okay what about uh what about your mammogram did you still do those oh yeah so i'm gonna probably that they don't send it they didn't send you a report i go in january they didn't send you anything well they might have let's say it was it was good it was clear so let me uh sometimes they do i just you know that's not always real obvious the way this oh okay oh yeah no they did i got it it just it doesn't it's not the way this is organized it doesn't pop right in my face so i just wonder if they sent it because you were the one that i think it from you because now i go to the uh yeah since i kind of yeah so just just whatever you're getting close to get ready just call me i'll send the also now Now the way we do it here, the order goes right over there electronically anyway. What? Good. I always go in January. That's good. How about the eye doctor? You've been to the eye doctor? Yeah, we went in French. Okay, and everything was good. Okay. The same glasses forever. Okay. So we went through you at the table because they're hearing. Okay. And you feel like the hearing aids are helping? Oh, yeah. I can't. Okay. But I am. I love some hearing what it's fine. You know, you don't leave those in. I just want to look at the eyes. I'd say, oh. Good. There's what my time. Here's something. Yeah, but I mean, you got to do all this. I just, that sounds. I just don't know. They don't think in church, and they didn't expect. And I was thinking about this morning, because I had actually had mine dental checkup this morning. And if you go back in time before there was dentistry, I mean, most people by the time, if they even lived as long as you lived, didn't have teeth. Teeth were gone by them. And so. Yeah. And so. I think they had the money even to go. They're doing this. Well, it sounds crazy. I mean, at least now you can chew. I would think about how different your life would be if you couldn't chew. So doing all these things, I know, I know it takes all takes up time. It does make your life, I don't know. Oh my God, we don't use this way too. Oh, right. You press it in and out. And again, please. There one more. Good. And actually down on the time. table. Hold your breath for a moment. I'm going to listen to your neck. Good. Now you can relax and read normally. I'll listen to your heart. Listen at the bottom. Good. Your heart sounds good. The pincers work. Getting us stopped for suicide. Yes, you can go on up. This is your piece here? Yeah. You put it on me. Yeah, you could join that. I'm going to check your value in my sir. My one leg that's a little small one. I don't know why. You know, we all have, we all have benefit to something. extend as we get older. I think veins just leak a little bit. Like, I mean, I actually first. But it's just that it takes a little swollen. But I have this leg doesn't. Yeah. Well, I have, but I have it too. I don't know. So I have a little bit of swelling in this leg. Um, you know, and I had the hips done in both legs. I don't know why one would be more than the other but they it's just i don't know it is it's the mystery whatever but i mean i can walk around i move you know so like I can't complain too much. All right, now, are you good with your prescriptions? I think, well, I think you have to look to see what I have the four prescriptions. Oh, and the other thing is the, is it am, um, say, amoxys. I know I need that because when I go to the dentist, I have to, you know, pre-medicate myself, so I think. What do you take? You take four amoxicill tablets? Do you want me to send that in now? I don't need, I only need. need eight because um well i don't know yeah eight i'll tell you why because i have four left for for thursday i'll go to the dentist and then i'll need some for next year so if you could get me eight eight of them yeah eight that's okay you took four of them before she she just called me ball out at the shop right she said kameel don't forget to premedicate i'm okay but you do it an hour ahead of time an hour ahead of time yeah yeah and she said you know make sure you don't lie because she was telling me a story about somebody that don't lie yeah yeah she's no don't like i said what i know she said i'm only saying that because somebody we know that they i guess they wound up getting a bad infection and they passed away because they had an infection in their mouth i mean i never had sores or anything wearing but still you probably be fine um you want the cvs over there on rooslay yes please I mean, patients do that all the time, though. I remember this one man I had this a long time ago who was, he came to see me because he was really worried because he was just turning 40, but his father died when he was 40. So we thought they had a heart attack, so he wanted to be checked out. And I said, well, you know, you haven't any symptoms, having any chest? He was no, no, I feel good. I said, all right, EKG was normal. Blood work was okay. Well, there was one little abnormality, but it was a weird thing. And so I... I said, so nothing's bothering, yeah. And so I said, I guess, you know, just come and see me a couple of months and we'll just, I'll just keep checking, see if anything changes. So then, like, just two or three days later, there was a story. There was a baseball player, a professional baseball player who, you know, didn't show up to the ballpark one day. And so they went back and found him dead in his hotel room. And this guy was only like 30, 30, 31, something like that. the story was apparently his father had died early. So I heard that. And I called the guy that my patient back up. I said, listen, you just heard that story? I said, I want you to go and see the cardiologist. I said, I don't know what's going on here, but that scared me too much. That was too coincidental. He goes to the finally, it took me, he procrastinated, but he finally goes and the Cardinal just calls me up. He said, boy, I'm really glad you sent this guy over to see me. And I said, well, why? I said, well, we just put him on, you know, we have him on the treadmill. He goes, it's. It's terrible. I'm taking him straight to the hospital right now. We're going to put a stent in him today. And I said, wow, I'm surprised. Yeah, I said, I'm surprised he wasn't having chest pain. He said, well, guess what? He was lying to you. He was having chest pain all the long. He not only didn't say it, he specifically denied it. I thought he's, he, the funny thing was that the guy goes, yeah, you should see what had to do to keep his wife from checking joking but anyway he he's alive and well today that was at least 20 years ago and he's no he's still alive and well he's well now he follows up with the cardiologist he does everything he's supposed to do and whatever well it can't it can't hurt you know I I tell people people ask me that all the time and I'll say you know if you're not having any symptoms you don't have to do it but I said you know what it's not a bad idea I get another opinion, you know, whatever. You might do a bunch of things that turn out to be, well, you didn't really. need to do them but but you know what but so what if you know your insurance is going to cover it so what's that what the heck and um and if they just tell you how you don't need to come back here for 10 years or something then then you're okay so yeah so i um i i i have a every well ever since then i have a much shorter short a leash for sending people over to the uh to the cardiologist because because that i mean he even asked the cardiologist just or the wife and he said you know what you know if he hadn't come today you know could you know he when when would something bad have happened the guy said you know you can't you can't know that for sure he goes but certainly it would have been within months it would have been and it obviously could have because it took him over a month to make the appointment before he finally got around to make it the appointment so it could have happened in between the time i told him the guy but he said the guy said it certainly would have happened within within sometime within the next few months he could have been the next day could have been you know in three or four months fortunately he got in there they got it done and then like you said he's been he's been good ever since but i mean that was uh that was and why he uh why he why he lied and he gave it was it the trouble of coming here but didn't want to tell me he was having the chest pain because that would have that would have changed everything to what i did i mean i just don't know i mean they told me after i had a chamber the doctor said said to my daughter well she doesn't need her pacemaker and then they called me and then overnight and say get to the hospital immediately oh really said why well you're an aphib i didn't know i didn't have any symptoms well a lot of times you don't i mean you're i was on a monitor oh i said that's how they knew because they said well how do you know they said well your monitor is showing you're an aphib gets in the hospital immediately i called my son i said mark you have to take me to the hospital He goes, maybe she'll believe. I said, no, just get me to the hospital. But they didn't put the pacemaker in until three days. later but they were monitoring me in the hospital. Yeah. And what I'm saying is they said I probably wouldn't need one and then I needed one. Okay. Well, but at least they were, but at least they were doing the monitoring so they could pick it up. So. They said, why? This was at 2.30 in the morning at the focus range. I thought first was a wrong number and I picked it up. Camille, get to the hospital. It's right. All right. Well, anyway, it looks like you're doing okay right now. So I would, oh, I was about to look up medication. So I just took care of the amoxicillin. And then let's see. Okay, so the atorvastatin. You need that refilled? So let's refill that one. If it's too soon, they won't give. Well, they'll just hold it. That's okay. These are microsome. These are microphones. I don't know. Let's take care of the Atorvistan. All right. And you said this is going to Optum. So that's the Atoribistan. And then, let me get back to the list here. Do you still have to take the cinema? What's that? Carbidopa. Lepidopa? No. That's done? No. I went to the, he said not quite. Parkinson's? Thank God for them. That's for sure. Who should go to Dr. Wauserstrom? Yeah. Yeah, no, he just retired. Let's see, that's 40 milligrams. Let's see, that's 40 milligrams. And then... That makes you wait. Yeah, that's it. Come on. I hope that doesn't mean this. I hope that doesn't mean this, the network's about to go down. down. I don't see. I'm sorry. So you got Tumassart and hydrochlorathizide. Now, of course. Okay. And what about Metoprol? Yeah, it's 25 million. You need that one to be filled? I have 50 milligrams. So, oh, so he probably sent the prescripted. Oh, he didn't? Okay. So he wants you to change it to 20 milligrams. 25. So hold on, you got to go up here then. Okay, but you said 25 minutes, okay. And the eloquess, you want Malloway to also, right? It's five. well until they're sure that you're not going to be any of them anymore that takes a lot of okay all right so that's all your prescriptions so you should be good you should be good for those for the for the next 12 months um anything else that you can think of okay i just wanted to tell you about the shingle shop because she said it was the old one and it was in 2015 so once you get done with everything get get get the new one and then uh then you'll be you'll be in good shape okay"", 'diarized_transcript_csv_url': ''}"

Evaluation and management of scrotal tightness and vasectomy consultation

HPI: 
Patient is a male who presents with concerns about changes in his scrotum noticed approximately one month ago. He reports waking up and feeling that his scrotum was ""tighter than normal,"" stating he is usually ""very loose"" but has been ""super tight"" since. The tightness comes and goes but has never returned to his baseline looseness. He denies pain associated with this change. While examining himself, he noticed what he describes as ""super thick veins on the left side"" which he states have been present since childhood. He reports feeling an area where ""the vein meets the testicle"" that feels ""a little bit harder or more dense."" He denies urinary symptoms, pelvic pain, testicular pain, scrotal pain, lower abdominal pain, or trauma to the area. He does report experiencing occasional testicular pain described as a ""little twinge"" that occurs approximately once every five months and resolves quickly. No recent changes in exercise. Patient has three children from four attempts at conception, denying any fertility issues. He is also interested in discussing vasectomy options.

Physical Exam:
Abdomen: No pain on palpation.
Groin: No pain or bulging noted. No evidence of hernia.
Penis: No pain or abnormalities.
Testicles: Right testicle smaller than left, which patient reports has been longstanding. Left testicle normal in size and consistency. No masses palpated in either testicle.
Spermatic cords: Palpable bilaterally. Thickened spermatic cord on left side but no definite abnormality identified. Vas deferens palpable bilaterally.

Laboratory Results:

Imaging Results:

Procedure:

Plan:
1. Scrotal tightness - Likely musculoskeletal in origin. Recommended pelvic stretches to help with muscle tightness in groin area.

2. Testicular asymmetry - Chronic. Right testicle smaller than left, which patient reports is longstanding. No masses palpated. Ordered scrotal ultrasound for further evaluation and reassurance.

3. Possible varicocele - Chronic. Patient reports thick veins on left side since childhood. No definitive varicocele identified on exam, but thickened cord noted. Scrotal ultrasound will help evaluate this further.

4. Vasectomy consultation - Patient interested in vasectomy. Discussed procedure details including technique (middle scrotal incision, isolation of vas deferens, placement of metal clips, segment removal, and lumen cauterization). Reviewed potential complications including infection, testicular injury, and post-procedure swelling. Emphasized importance of post-vasectomy semen analysis at 3 months. Patient prefers lab drop-off for semen analysis rather than at-home testing. Will have scheduler contact patient to arrange procedure if he decides to proceed after discussing with his wife. The risks, benefits, and alternatives of the proposed procedure were discussed with the patient at length and in detail. Possible complications including but not limited to pain, infection, bleeding, scar tissue formation, injury to adjacent structures, and the need for postoperative treatments including further surgical procedures were explained. Will schedule under sedation.  Risk factors include obesity.

So basically, like a month ago, I woke up and my strode and felt different. Like, I woke up and I was like, you know, I just felt different. I guess I came to the conclusion that I was tighter than normal. Okay. I'm usually very loose, like very, very loose. And I was... super tight and I'm like yeah it could be a million things so I don't know but it's been a month and it like it comes and goes a little bit but it's never been like as loose as it was before is it painful no no but with all this happening I guess I was examining a little more and I've always had like super thick veins on the left side it's just it's been how it was since I was a kid and as I was feeling those veins a little bit it feels just it's been how it was since I was a kid and as I was feeling those veins a little bit it feels like there's where the vein meets the testicle is a little bit harder or more dense it's not like hard but it's definitely i don't know i've never felt it before and you know it's been like a week and a half of me just thinking about i'm like i just got out yeah we'll check it out any urinary symptoms no no no no urinary symptoms no pain in the pelvic area your pain of the testicles a scrotum the lower abdomen trauma to the area. Nope. No. Changes in exercise recently? No. No, I wish. I wish I'd be exercising more. But, I mean, I do get a pain, but I don't want to... Like, it happens, like, once every five months, I'll be like, ooh, and then it'll go away. Like a little twinge in the testicle. Yeah. Okay, it's probably nothing. Maybe, like, a muscle spasm. Okay. Let's take a look. It's probably nothing, but... Yeah, that's, you know what, I'm going on vacation and I'm, you know, I'd just feel better if somebody's dead. Sure, so you pull the shorts and I'm, you know, I just feel better if somebody looked at it. Sure. You can pull the shorts and underwear down and you can sit down. All right, to lay back. So when I push on your belly, any pain? Any pain in the groin area or bulging in the groin, like a hernia? starch in the penis, pain in the penis itself. No. I mean, you're right, testicle. It feels a little small. Has it always been that size? Yeah, it's always been significantly smaller than the other one. I don't know if it's gotten smaller or whatnot, but it's definitely been smaller than the left. It's small, but nothing abnormal. Like nothing abnormal. The cord feels fine. Do you have kids? I do. Okay. Yeah, three for four. We tried four times. We got pregnant three. That's a no fertility. thing abnormal the cord feels fine um and you have kids do okay yeah three for four we're trying four times we got pregnant three that's a no fertility issues. No. Yeah, the left testicle feels normal. Yeah. The cord, yeah, I don't feel anything on your cord here. Can I show you what I'm feeling? Yeah. So it's like, I can't feel it really when I'm laying down. Well, you know what we'll do? Sometimes you can't, you make you you I'll send you for a sonogram with your scorer okay I'm unlikely to find anything you're good you can pull pants and underwear but sometimes it's just good for reassurance. Yeah. Okay. That works. Yeah. So I'm sending you for a score of an ultrasound. If any, when we get the results, if any issues, I'll let you know. I don't feel anything abnormal. That's weird how it wasn't there when I laid down. It could be, sometimes you get, like, a varicose veins. Yeah.

Okay, awesome. that's what i want to do you usually or it's like sometimes you feel like a little cyst in your epididymus right right so let me order that for you oh do you guys do vasectomy yeah is that something you yeah oh okay um or at least talk about yeah yeah yeah um let me just pull up here bretsker yeah so um I do vasectomies at our surgery center. We make a little incision in the middle of the scrotum. We bring each vass up individually. I put a small metal clip on both sides of the tube, snip a segment, like between the two clips. I burn the lumen of the tube. We do that on each side. Okay. That's what will be a problem with the enlarged veins or anything like that? No, you know, you do have like a thick and spramatic where sometimes it makes the anatomy a little bit more difficult. Sometimes I can't do it through one. I usually do one little incision that big sometimes I got to make a second. for one on the other side okay um but uh but yeah i do them usually Tuesday afternoons it's quick procedure 10 minutes we sedate you for it okay it's like twilight yeah okay um what about like performance you know it's not something i've ever had an issue with before is that don't affect no no no no it shouldn't affect that All right, so let me give you a script for the scortle ultrasound. Okay. and then i can have um i could have my office call you to schedule it okay yeah yeah let me talk my wife a little bit and then uh yeah yeah that'd be good now really like as far as risk of the procedure go pretty low risk things like infection injury to the testicles um like swelling from like bleeding could happen afterwards it's very rare the most important thing is getting a semen analysis three months after. So nature's clear. You could either do that with an ad home test, which costs about $140 out of pocket, or you can go to a drop off that lap core. Okay. Okay. So, but that's important because if you don't do that test and you get pregnant, it's kind of on you. Absolutely.

I'm going to tug on the screen. Let's see this side. You know, this side. You know, this side is a little bit now. So, because it's so small. Right. Oh. There is. There's your right bass. It's like a thin noodle, you know? Yeah. See, like I can feel that thing again. Yeah, it's right where it meets it. Yeah, it's probably just, you're just feeling rapid doing this. What about the tightness? That's probably like, you know, you feel like a pulling of the muscles in the groin. Okay. So doing some pelvic stretches can help with that. Okay.

I guess I came to the conclusion that I was tighter than normal. Okay. I'm usually very loose, like very, very loose. And I was... super tight and I'm like yeah it could be a million things so I don't know but it's been a month and it like it comes and goes a little bit but it's never been like as loose as it was before is it painful no no but with all this happening I guess I was examining a little more and I've always had like super thick veins on the left side it's just it's been how it was since I was a kid and as I was feeling those veins a little bit it feels just it's been how it was since I was a kid and as I was feeling those veins a little bit it feels like there's where the vein meets the testicle is a little bit harder or more dense it's not like hard but it's definitely i don't know i've never felt it before and you know it's been like a week and a half of me just thinking about i'm like i just got out yeah we'll check it out any urinary symptoms no no no no urinary symptoms no pain in the pelvic area your pain of the testicles a scrotum the lower abdomen trauma to the area. Nope. No. Changes in exercise recently? No. No, I wish. I wish I'd be exercising more. But, I mean, I do get a pain, but I don't want to... Like, it happens, like, once every five months, I'll be like, ooh, and then it'll go away. Like a little twinge in the testicle. Yeah. Okay, it's probably nothing. Maybe, like, a muscle spasm. Okay. Let's take a look. It's probably nothing, but... Yeah, that's, you know what, I'm going on vacation and I'm, you know, I'd just feel better if somebody's dead. Sure, so you pull the shorts and I'm, you know, I just feel better if somebody looked at it. Sure. You can pull the shorts and underwear down and you can sit down. All right, to lay back. So when I push on your belly, any pain? Any pain in the groin area or bulging in the groin, like a hernia? starch in the penis, pain in the penis itself. No. I mean, you're right, testicle. It feels a little small. Has it always been that size? Yeah, it's always been significantly smaller than the other one. I don't know if it's gotten smaller or whatnot, but it's definitely been smaller than the left. It's small, but nothing abnormal. Like nothing abnormal. The cord feels fine. Do you have kids? I do. Okay. Yeah, three for four. We tried four times. We got pregnant three. That's a no fertility. thing abnormal the cord feels fine um and you have kids do okay yeah three for four we're trying four times we got pregnant three that's a no fertility issues. No. Yeah, the left testicle feels normal. Yeah. The cord, yeah, I don't feel anything on your cord here. Can I show you what I'm feeling? Yeah. So it's like, I can't feel it really when I'm laying down. Well, you know what we'll do? Sometimes you can't, you make you you I'll send you for a sonogram with your scorer okay I'm unlikely to find anything you're good you can pull pants and underwear but sometimes it's just good for reassurance. Yeah. Okay. That works. Yeah. So I'm sending you for a score of an ultrasound. If any, when we get the results, if any issues, I'll let you know. I don't feel anything abnormal. That's weird how it wasn't there when I laid down. It could be, sometimes you get, like, a varicose veins. Yeah.

Evaluation and management of joint pain and fatigue with concern for possible lupus

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Mr. Anthony Moya is a 33-year-old male who presents to rheumatology clinic for evaluation of multiple joint pains, fatigue, and concern for possible lupus. Patient reports his mother has lupus. His symptoms include fatigue, difficulty sleeping, dry mouth, chest pain, constipation, bloating, headaches, memory loss, pain in multiple joints, anxiety, and depression. These symptoms have been present for approximately 4-5 years.

Patient was previously seen in the ER in October 2023 for left arm and leg weakness and numbness. At that time, he had a normal EKG, negative CT head, and negative CT angiogram for large vessel occlusion. An echocardiogram showed no pericardial effusion, normal left ventricular size with ejection fraction of 55-60%, no mitral regurgitation, normal atrial size, and normal tricuspid valve structure. MRI of the cervical spine showed no evidence of cervical spinal cord parenchymal lesions or compression, with a  possible suspected hemangioma noted. Brain MRI was negative according to the radiologist.

OBJECTIVE:
Physical Examination:
Gen: Well developed well nourished. 
HEENT: PERRLA, EOMI, sclera anicteric, oropharynx clear, no oral ulcers. 
Nodes: No cervical adenopathy. 
Chest: Clear bilaterally. 
Heart: S1 S2 no murmurs, regular heartbeat.

Neuro: motor and sensory grossly intact. Musculoskeletal: Normal gait. No swelling noted in joints in both upper and lower extremities. Faber test negative bilaterally. Tenderness on palpation of trochanteric bursa region bilaterally. Mild crepitus noted on extension and flexion of the knees. No tenderness on palpation of the MTP joints bilaterally.  No tenderness on palpation of the Achilles tendon insertion site bilaterally.

ASSESSMENT:
1. Chronic fatigue and joint pain - Clinically, I do not see any signs of underlying rheumatological inflammatory connective tissue disease or arthropathy. The patient does not have any rash, no photosensitivity rash, no oral ulcers, and no significant synovitis in the hands, feet, or any joints. The patient complains of fatigue, anxiety, and poor sleep, which raises concern for chronic fatigue syndrome/chronic pain syndrome. This is a diagnosis of exclusion, and comprehensive blood work will be ordered to rule out other possible etiologies.

2. Acid reflux - Patient reports significant acid reflux with metallic taste in the morning and regurgitation. Previous trial of Pepcid resulted in allergic reaction with itching. Will refer to gastroenterology for further evaluation and management.

3. Poor sleep - Patient reports interrupted sleep of approximately 6 hours per night with frequent awakenings. This may be contributing to his fatigue, joint pain, and cognitive issues. Will refer to sleep medicine for evaluation.

4. Trochanteric bursitis - Patient has tenderness over bilateral trochanteric bursa regions. This may be related to his scoliosis and prolonged sitting for work.

PLAN:
Will order comprehensive laboratory studies including ANA, SSA, SSB, CBC, CMP, ESR, CRP, urinalysis, urine protein/creatinine ratio, RF, C3, C4, CCP, RNP, Smith antibody, double-stranded DNA, hepatitis B core antibody, hepatitis B surface antibody, hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibody, and QuantiFERON Gold.

Referral to gastroenterology for evaluation of acid reflux.
Referral to sleep medicine for evaluation of sleep disturbance.
Referral to primary care physician for establishment of care.
Patient to return to clinic in two weeks to review laboratory results.

Patient is a non-smoking does not drink, it's employed, a single lives of its family. Hey, hey, how are you? Good, my name is Dr. Bodle. I have to meet you. All right, give me one second. Oh, okay. Yeah, she set me up to this one. Oh, okay. All right. All right. I don't know. I don't know. all right so i have you written that um do you have a family history of lupus is that correct or on your mother's side okay and it says you're having a joint pain or yeah i'm always missing but all my joint pains um they're just in pain constantly I get um I get sick and I notice, like, I don't get, like, a fever, but if I know when I'm sick, because I'm like the kids and everything, um, everything at once, even my, uh, the JFK hospital a long time ago diagnosed cost of congeritis. I said it wasn't a heart issue. Okay. So I, that would trigger, but I was able to, like, help help it out. I breathe. I drink water. And thankfully, before it gets like when I first experienced with the pressure on the chest okay um I get my migraines I had one last night um I see it's up for a lot of the wrists and so I used to play sports and um for example like now if I try to play basketball for like five minutes or something yeah I've tried to happen a while, but let's say months ago, I'll try, and I can't, for some reason, my lungs won't let me. I never had that feeling where I can't play a, you know, I used to be in teams back and put, you know, full courts, a lot of higher running, like, I could do that. And now I can't even, like, something's put in it. It's not like with the, I don't know if it's with the, the rib or the lungs, like I can't, for some reason I could puts me down. Like, I have to, have to breathe. So I'm thinking it has to do with lungs or pressure something. I just never knew what it was, but I just, like, stopped. I never, I would just maybe shoot something and everything that will never do, like, hard sports anymore. Has your primary care doctor, like, looked into all of this, or? I don't even, I don't even know where to get primary. have been known since I moved to Jersey back from New York. And I was 18, it was just like urgent cares. There's a lot of urgent cares. Okay. And I totally... on the shoulder on time they put the quarter zone yeah yeah yeah twice but um it's very like i want to get the best one i tried the one where i lived at but he wasn't taking any money like i telling him when my chest they didn't do no test is nothing and i'm like i can't go to something that doesn't you know all right i mean we have uh we have primary care i mean i could refer you refer you to, you know, the primary girl. Yeah, I could trust because I, I saw them they're going to take it seriously. They probably see me like I'm young, and I don't know, you know, I might look young or maybe in the 30s, but I feel like really weak. So I'm like, especially here, I have like a little, to me, like a little bump here. Okay. And I know my grandfather, um, for a past way while they had to cut off his leg, I don't know if we have diabetes or something like that. So I just, do you have any medical history of anything? I have scoliosis. Oh, you have scoliosis. Yes, scoliosis. I know that puts a lot of pressure. like that. All right. Do you have any medical history of anything? I have scoliosis. Oh, you have scoliosis. Yes, scoliosis. I know that puts a lot of pressure. are here, which probably cause... Do you have acid reflux? Yes, I do. Because sometimes acid reflux can cause... I mean, you know, you could get pain here. It could be silent. Do you have metallic taste in the morning when you wake up? Every day, like every night, like I take a thums. And sometimes if I fell asleep out of nowhere and I didn't take the thames, it'll come up I used to choke on my toe up and I get it really really bad it sucks I have to get to mention that. So that might, you know, so costucondritis is, you know, it's just like, there can be, so what by definition is like, okay, you know, if you're pressed in this area, you constantly have discomfort and pain, right? But sometimes what can be overlooked is things like acid reflux. So if you have acid acid reflux that can cause all that as well I mean that you know so cost with like in size like no longer closing it could be or you know it because I get it super fast like as soon as I laid down like even the water just wants to like thank them and so that's the thing it might be beneficial to I mean I could give you a referral to GI that's fine but the other thing is you know seeing a primary care can obviously deal at least so you need a primary care because they act like your quarterback right if you keep on going to specialists think of them as receivers, they just run up and down, but it's a quarterback that is deciding, okay, what we should do or what we should look at. You know what I mean? So that's the thing. But I can definitely at least, if you're telling me you have acid reflux and having metallic taste and if you're throwing up, then you should be at least seen by GI. You know what I mean? And I could give you a referral for that. I'm new to this area myself so um like I moved here 12 weeks ago so um so I don't know anyone specifically you know what I mean so that that's the only thing but I can definitely you know at least give you a referral for all right going back to your joint pain how long have you had that for I probably noticed it maybe three four or five years ago oh there But I remember, like, you know, some people say when you get 30. Yeah, yeah. Getting older, you feel older, joints here, all that stuff. But and I started looking like sure I really feel like this because I want to be active. I want to exercise. I want to do with this stuff but I definitely feel weaker. I see. You know, sometimes I get it, well mostly here, here. In your, all my, um. The P.A. The middle knuckles. You're right here. All of them right now. Just really, yeah, I would like squeeze them. them or you know what helps a lot that I notice is when I grab like either icy or like a cold soda can and I hold it even these areas like right now hurt and I hold in if I could feel all the like release I could feel like all the pain being released from the cold I see okay I just don't know how to deal with it I don't really I don't take many prescriptions I like to really there's like Tyone or Advil help I don't know I never really like took for it like I just deal with it I just let it I kind of got like used to it I guess I don't know if like I propose from Thailand or I have a little work. I can try it, you know, that just you to see it. I just let it, I kind of got, like, used to it, I guess. I don't know if, like, I propose from Thailand or I have it will work. I don't know. I can try it. Just you to see it. What happened to your nails? I guess like probably like biting it too loud. Oh, you're, okay, all right. You bite your nails, okay. In terms of, now these are just general questions. Like any ulcers in your mouth or anything like that? Like it, like, you know, you see an ulcer like this rough spot or anything no like that do you have any skin rashes No, no skin rashes like in your scalp or around your belly button. I don't see around the elbows or knees. Yeah, okay. Nothing around the butt crap or anything like that. Okay. Do you, obviously you told me about acid reflux, do you get, and you said you have shortness of breath, correct? Yeah, like if I play heavy sports. I guess I'm assuming it's probably jumping or lifting or whatever back. We do like in five minutes. Yeah. That triggered, though. Like, it's like something that pressured it. Okay. And I have to stop. I can't even. I see. You don't have, but do you get shortness of breath if you're just sitting or anything? No, no, no. No, nothing like that. Okay. Do you have any blood in your stool or blood in your urine? No. Do you have any? Do your fingertips, if you expose them to cold, do they turn anything like this? Just by any chance? No. Not that, or anything like that? No, okay. All right, so that's good. No brain on. Your sleep is? My sleep? Yeah. I have a horrible time sleeping in the night. For how long years? Oh yeah A very long time All right, all right. It's tough for me to go to sleep sometime. I use these migraine glasses sometimes to just kind of, like, help me. If it gets a little darker in the room, if I'm on the phone, just stop the lights from keeping me out. I see it. And it kind of helps me. But other than that, without. Have you ever seen a sleep doctor? No, I didn't. I know that's why it's important to see a primary care, you know what I mean? I got so much issues with you know. I didn't even. So that's why it's important to see a primary care. You know what I mean? I got so much issues with you. You know what to do with me. So the one thing, so how many hours do you sleep at night? Uh, I think it was not a good time. Last night, I was to take migraine pills. And, um, but normally it could be six hours, I'll say. Okay. But is it interrupted six or is it like? Yes, unfortunately. Sometimes if I get up at like two in the morning, I probably won't go to sleep a couple of hours and then I wake up so that could be bad. Okay. And I have to look up with the kids and work. I see. get up at like two in the morning. I probably went to sleep for a couple of hours and then I wake up so that could be bad. Okay. And I have to wake up with the kids and work. I see. Do you have anxiety or depression or anything like that? I don't know. I don't see like a therapist, anything like that, but I could say, yeah. I think I think I could have that anxiety and depression. Okay. Not as bad as just as me to probably see someone, I think, in my opinion, but, you know, sometimes people feel down. Okay. All right. Sometimes I'm happy. All right. Um. Let's see. You said no blood in the urine. No. No pain when you urinate or anything like that. You know, sometimes it's like, you know, you use the bathroom. It's hard sometimes to be a shout, so. Okay. But, you know, I'm sure, so. Do you have any, um, any numbness or tingling in your hands or feet? I don't even notice that when I'm sleeping, but I don't know if I'm sleeping wrong with my arm probably or my legs. It's hard to tell. It is, you know, so... It goes away if I, like, you know... Okay. Do you have it, like, during the day or anything like that? No, not that I recall. They're mostly in the night, so they didn't probably sleep. And when you sit at night, just in the legs or... Or in the hands? It would probably mostly in the hands. In the hands? the hands and a little bit of the arm. Okay. Okay. It's probably going to sleep position. I don't know this sometimes. All right. Um. hands and a little bit of the arm. Okay. Okay. It's probably going to sleep position. I don't know this sometimes. All right. But sometimes I do get, what I notice is when in the daytime, sometimes I will feel, like, you know, you feel your skin, but you can't, like, you touch your skin, but you can't feel it. Sometimes I get that feeling where, like, it feels weird, and tingling, but I don't know. All right, okay. It's, like, if I was sick or something. That's the only word that I'm afraid of, though. I see what that happens. Right now, okay. I mean, I have some information, at least things that you've done in the past. You know, at least blood work done from two years ago, at least was all normal. I don't know if any of, you know, this is just a while back, like I guess when you did it in January of 23. I never know of what. Okay of 23? Oh, I don't know if we're watching. Okay, alright. So, I mean, The only thing is, like, you know, from a lupus standpoint, and obviously we will evaluate you. But, like, looking at the blood work, at least that was done at that time, your urine was perfectly fine. You know, your cell counts, your white blood cell count, hemoglobin and platelet count, and your lymphocyte count, which are things that we look at, typically, because those are things that are affected in lus, we Okay. Um, your, you know, electrolytes, your sodium, I mean, your liver enzymes, everything, normal there as well so at least I don't have any you know I guess blood work wise yeah to suggest that there's anything going on the only thing you know my concern is when you were younger were you super flexible no flexible but I was very active you were very active or sports track okay okay all right you can't like touch your thumb to your forearm right like that can you like the back of the forearm No, no. No. It was all I played was basketball. Okay, all right. You can't, like, touch your thumb to your forearm or anything like that. Can you, like, the back of the forearm? No, no. No. Okay, okay, or the other side. I mean, you have to bend the wrist and then the back. No, no. No, okay. Okay, all right. I did read about it. It takes a while before you. Yeah, yeah, yeah. The only concern I have is just at least listening so far. So poor sleep can cause joint pain. Okay. So do you have brain fog? Like, you feel like you don't remember things oh that's why that's another thing i was gonna because i forget a lot i was supposed to write these things down yes uh recently i noticed that i had to write everything down my phone literally has all my work stuff that i i have to take in a daily basis yeah my calendar's completely full my notes is full i forget a lot now where like if we're from having a conversation i want to mention something for some reason just boom and have even like sometimes I know about car parts and I'm on my phone I can't remember now I remember a throttle body and I couldn't remember that it was completely blanked back in picture. Like, yeah, and that was like super bad for me because I was really good to remember a lot of things, and I was just, like, getting a lot. So that might all be related to poor sleep. So what happens is that when you don't sleep well, your brain doesn't relax, right? So sometimes people think, oh, I'm sleeping, but if they're snoring or if they're just, you know, tossing and turning, their brain is constantly on. You know what I? I mean, it's not relaxing. And so the way the brain communicates with you is through pain receptors, right? So the more you don't sleep well, the more pain you'll have. But then more pain you have, the more you won't sleep well. So it's a cycle that's hard to break. And then if you add anxiety and stress and depression into that, things just sort of explode explode but the reason why people get brain fog is because they're not resting their brain and that's another sign of that. And so that's why it's like, you know, I just question if maybe many of your symptoms could be related to sleep. You know what I mean? Of not sleeping well. Now, you said five years ago this is when all these symptoms started. At least I want to say I noticed. But prior to that, you were perfectly fine? Or did you still have symptoms? Like, I never had to, like, go to the doctor and get sick. I didn't, like, um, that's probably what, you know, that's where I didn't have primary care, I guess, you know, I'm supposed to check up, but when I really got sick, I never had any, like, you know, if I got injured, got cut, something when, you know, urgent care, sorry. But you did, thankfully, but did you have these symptoms prior to five years? Like, any of these, like, joint pain? It's tough to remember. I want to, I want to say, I don't know. Like I said, like said it crept up because I didn't notice it. I'm thinking, okay, you know, I could tolerate a lot of, like, high pain. You know, I got the cause of cartilage was one of the worst or migraines, one of the worst. So then you got these, you know, it's bothering me and I'm just, like, massaging it. Mm-hmm. And I never really thought of it, thinking just, okay, maybe it's just pain or something. You know, type, whatever. I guess it could be five it's more i really really can't remember i don't have anything to go back on The other question, any history of Lyme disease or anything like that have been, you have never been checked with Lyme or anything like, don't have you? No. All right. Any severe dry eyes or dry mouth? I do feel like I do get dehydrated pretty quick. Okay. I don't drink a lot of water too. I know that also may have to do with anything too. Okay. It's, uh, It's tough because, obviously, I'm trying to, the more of what I drink too, the acid reflex. Yes, yes, it's a fun. I'm trying to, like, try to drink those little ice cubes to help a little bit. And now, or just drink it in the room temperature. It might have more for me. Okay. Do you drink a lot? Do you have any diarrhea or anything like that? Uh, not in a daily basis. No, okay. Any easy bruising or anything like that? Like bruises you see, you're like, where did they come from? Or like that or not? No, thank you. No. No. I'm going to be. I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to be. I don't know. I want to try taking like a melatonin, but I think the five one it took was a little tough because I have the same kids too. Okay. It could get seizures, so she's on my maintenance and then my autistic son and my ID so it's smart for me to take something that's going to put me to sleep and I can't wake up to them I see. I'm a little afraid. I don't know, maybe one or a two. I don't know if you could help. I could still force myself well, but the five was just, I used to take the five mile back when I just had the one kid. I see. I used to help, but it's just, I can't even get up in the morning to feel like the trials in the whole day so it was not good in the morning. I would say, I mean, I would say, I mean, you could. It's a natural way, right, Melitone? There's the other things you could also do you could drink like warm glass of milk you know kiwis tend to help help you know you sleep but the thing is it's like if you're stressed out or have anxiety and stuff like that then you might not be able to you know what I mean and so that it's like a multi-prong approach meaning that okay let's say if I said if you go to a sleep doctor He'll be like, okay, let's say if I said, if you go to a sleep doctor, he'll be like, okay, let's just check, you make sure you don't have sleep apnea, rest of leg, things like that, right? And then it's like, okay, so you don't have anything medical, but you don't sleep well, right? But if, let's say your anxiety is not under control or something, or like, you know, you're a lot of under stress, obviously that is going to play a role in not, of you not sleeping well. So that's the thing, and so that's why it's like a multi-prong approach of, okay, like, you know, doing a couple of things at the same time. um to try to get your sleep better my feeling is if if your sleep does get better then i think many symptoms might actually get better you know what i mean specifically as a brain fog yeah yeah because i have to put like foam and everything like making more so yeah yeah and so that that's the thing it's it you know a lot of symptoms can be related to just poor sleep. It is like, it is like eight hours a minimum. It is as long as you, but, yeah, so as long as it's not interrupted, right? And the thing is making sure that you have been ruled out for, like, sleep me and things like that um yeah like this morning all the kids jumped in the the night and i'm like i even know when i was there and then the other one kid i just sleep on the opposite side of the they got the bunk bed so i can't even go on there's um so yeah definitely is like a little interruption all right you can take out your shoes and socks for me and your hat as well. Thank you. Yeah, I know when I go to sleep, I go to massage thing, in Menlo-a-Moh, I don't know, I know you can move with kid, there's one in Menlo-Mole, they do massage, I'll tell the lady just to focus on the lights, and I hadn't had that in, like, months, and it was the most painful, but, like, she took all that pain away, that heaviness, like, that, like, that felt heaviness, she took all that with a sergeant, it was so painful, though, because it's like... Doing it? Yeah, but it... that pain away that heaviness she took all that away with a sergeant I was like oh my it was so painful though it's like doing it yeah but it like took all the relief so it was like both at the same time let me ask you this like i don't know if you look at things like this but i was trying to like am i the one feeling this or not or it's just me was it the muscle or because like i always like either it grew a little bit more like a little bold there or went small then um alba noticed at one point it's all finally somebody then my 15-year-old daughter noticed okay i'm not going crazy but it's like not going to the point like it's like you mean right here yeah it's around like and that's where it always hurts when I try to massage. It could be a muscle knot. Oh, okay. You know what I mean? If that's what you're talking about. Yeah. And I thankfully haven't had a cramp in a while, like they would try to sneak up. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Because things are painful in the calf. But this side definitely doesn't, like, you know, and you can tell, like, right, right here is where exactly I want to, like, always I'm sorry. Over your mouth. Like, you know, I need to tell, like, right, right here is where exactly I want to, like, always have to start. Over your mouth. Tune up. Tip your head up. Look down to me. Open your eyes. Look up here. You've had your thyroid checked and everything. Oh, what's that? I'm sorry. Do I say your thyroid gland? Does anyone check? Well, I assume not. Who in the family has lupus? My mother. You said your mother. She's in Russia. Okay. All right. Deep breaths in it up. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Any pain where I push? No. Any pain back here, down here when I push? No. Any pain up here when I push? Yeah, this pain. Oh, in these two areas. Yeah. And then down here? No, not right now, yeah. Here it does hurt. Yeah. Is I here when I do this? No. Any discomfort when I do that? Or this? No. I like for some reason, like I like pressure. Like, I put my hand on the pillow and I need, like, pressure on anything. Like, I don't mind. Pressure. Are you pain or discomfort when I do this? No. If your kids hug you, like, quickly, like, don't touch me? No, no, I can't wait. Okay. Maybe mom is after a few hours in dealing with... Do you pain when I do that? No, no, thankfully. Yeah, I guess the elbows is probably the least because I'm not walking on that. That's why these were at the moment. Any pain right push? Yeah, just like I could feel. Sightly? But it's like only on the sides. I know it's like going with those yeah but only the middle is This one hurt when I do that or not? Yeah, usually the middle ones hurt the most, but all of them show. Like, you know, like, pain, like, to me, it's like when I squeeze it, it feels like... It's supposed to be pain, I guess, but it feels like I'm trying to put the pressure off. All right, let it go. Any pain, I do that? No, but I just get pain here, like I want to, like, squeeze exactly what you're doing. I have both palms for some reason. I don't know what that has to do with the thumb. No, but I just get pain here, like I want to like squeeze exactly what you're doing. Both palms for some reason. I don't know what that has to do with the thumb. Any numbness or tingling when I do this? No. No. I mean if there's any pain where I push. No pain when I do that? No, no, probably. Not like that like any dumb pain. Okay. You feel like a little bit of it, but it's not like the spring pain. All right. And these are all you're chewing on these nails? Yeah. All right. It's like automatic, I don't even know. I'm doing this sometimes. Okay. Okay. Any're not there yet. Any pain when I do that? No. I guess she had an induction. Are you pain where I push? No. Okay. Okay. Let me back. Let me for a second. Bend this knee. Any pain when I do that? No. Okay. Bend it. Rotated up? Any pain in the hips or anything? Yeah, that's the main ones that I always try to stretch. Right there? Yeah, like, I guess my father has sciatica, so he said it could be sciatica, too. But I try to do that stretch where you bring it over. Okay. I stretch it, because that's the worst part, I guess, because I sit a lot for work. Any pain in the back when I do this? Or nothing? No, No. Let's check the opposite. I'm just knee. Any pain when I do that? No. Any pain when I do that? do this? No, I see me. Any pain when I... Nothing like that? Just beside the muscle. Okay. Does it hurt when I push right here? It's... It's what the bones are right. Right here? Yeah, unfortunately. So it's hard to say what that could be, do you do? I do sit a lot. You do. So if you have scoliosis, it can come from the back, that is what we call. all of the trochanter bursa region. So sometimes people say, oh, I have a bursitis. There's no joint there, right? Our hip joint is in our groin area. This right here is basically where you have the shaft of the femur, right? On top of that, you have a liquid sack, and on top of that is the muscle. So what happens is that if the muscle was just on top of the bone then obviously the bone would shred the muscle apart. So that fluid sac allows the muscle to smoothly glide over the bone. But you can get pain in that area, and that's why they call that the trochentric bursa region, or bursitis. But you don't know if it's actually the bursa that's inflamed, or if you have a tendinitis or a tendonopathy, or if it can be pain coming from the back. Being that it's on both, it's not, sciatic pain would be shooting pain going from the back down the leg. So, But this might be just, you know, more of a tendinopathy. And stretching stuff like that is helpful. I mean, I could obviously send you to physical therapy for that. But if you're like, no, you know, I know what I'm doing, that's fine. But I tend to send patients to physical therapy if they have a lot of issues. And if it's still hurts, you can get those areas injected typically done by orthopedics or sports medicines. Right, you can get those areas injected, typically done by orthopedics or sports medicines. All right, you can get back. Go ahead, you put on your shoes, I'm sorry. So clinically, I don't see signs of lupus. My concern is just like, so we'll do a complete workup anyways, right, from a rheumatological sense. You know, I'm going to check you for everything um not just only you know um you know, the general markers, but I'm also going to check you for specific markers for lupus to see if there's anything that is there. But clinically I don't see anything. The one thing I tell patients is that, look, you know, it's not all on blood work, right? Because all these diseases have a criteria. And you have to, you know, it's one thing, you know, and for these criteria for these diseases it's like you have to meet a clinical and a blood work blood work criteria you know what I mean but at least so far and then how we make a diagnosis is based on history your physical exam and blood work and do they all match up right I've had some patients who might have a marker positive but they don't have any clinical findings right now your symptoms are a bit non-specific right but you know like what I was looking for, I'm like, all right, obviously you have had an echo done in the past, at least I got that information. And there's no, like, you know, fluid around your heart, in your lungs or anything like that, things that we would see with lupus. Obviously, I don't see any severe rashes. I don't see any ulcers in your mouth. I don't see significant swelling or anything like that, right? Your joints feel normal to me. So I don't see any overt signs of lupus. Obviously, blood work done in the past has been normal. But we will make sure that we have checked everything. to me. So I don't see any overt signs of lupus. Obviously, blood work done in the past has been normal, but we will make sure that we have checked everything. I'm also going to check, you know, what we consider, like, non-rumatological. So I'm going to check your thyroid and make sure that is okay. All right. And then... I don't know. And if you would like, uh, hold on, hold on. I don't know So, like I said, I'm going to check you for non-rubatological as well, and what I mean by that is, I'm going to check you for non-rubatological as well. And what I mean by that is I'm going to check your thyroid. But check you for Lyme disease, make sure you don't have that. Sometimes people might have Lyme disease and can cause similar symptoms. You know what I mean? So if you have never been checked for that, that's one thing. I'm going to give you a referral to GI because if you really have badass reflux where you're throwing up, then I think that should be evaluated. The last person just told me to take the over-the-counter. Pepsit? But it was no good for me. I was getting itchy through. I never know I was allergic to it. Yeah. Until I think when I was taking it, it was so itchy. So I didn't even was allergic to it. Yeah. Until I think when I was taking it, it was so itchy. So I didn't think it could be. Yeah, no, I mean, and so that's why I think seeing a specialist might be helpful for that perspective. In terms of a primary care, there is, I mean, I don't know where her office is located. There's a Dr. Caracetas that people are happy. with, you know, um, I could definitely refer you to her, you know, um, you know, um, you know, just so you have someone to look at, maybe some of your other symptoms, you know what I mean? Because obviously it's sort of beyond my expert, or at least by, you know, um, yeah, yeah, um, so, um, so, so, because for me, the, the thing is, you you know you might have what we call chronic fatigue syndrome or Chronic pain syndrome, which are basically things, or at least what we consider them as diseases, are where people have chronic pain or chronic fatigue. And, you know, it's, there isn't great treatment for it, but you try to, you know, treat the symptoms to the best of your ability. But like I said, it's a multi-prong approach. So, and what makes me say that is because you're saying if you have chronic pain or I've had these symptoms for more than five years you get tired easily you're not sleeping well your brain fog and then you have these non-specific you know joint pain but clinically it's like i don't see anything you know what i mean and so we sometimes define that as okay that could be chronic pain but that is a diagnosis of exclusion and what i mean by that is that we first rule everything out and then i could say that but just listening to your history that's what it sounds like you know what I mean? Sometimes I don't even notice the stuff until like and like, you know, just thinking like it's normal, like, yeah, yeah, stuff. I mean, some could be, some of it could be, but I think the crux of the two things that you said that would make me be like, okay, that these two are issues is the sleep not being well, and if you're having a lot of anxiety, those two things can play a role in making you feel the way you are. So that's the thing. And so if that's the case, then treating those two things is important, you know, regardless of what the lab shows. You know what I mean? Like, you know, if your thyroid is abnormal, sure, we can send you to a thyroid specialist and things like that. But at the end, it's like, or your primary, you know, the primary care doctor can take care of it as well but Do you feel you are, you have any depression right now, like that, or not so much where you're like, no, not now, but? No, I think it only happens in like, sorry, like, you know, I think it would trigger like a sad event or something. something, you know, just to do something, but, you know, I try to keep a positive mind all the time. I think, it's hard because I, I, no way to really diagnose myself in without a profession, but I think it could be it because, um, I notice someone on the phone, I can't stay still. I hope thank you for, if we have to, yeah, yeah, I noticed that, I've never had a profession, but I think it could be it because I noticed I'm on the phone, I can't stay still. I hope that's for it. Yeah, yeah. I noticed that, I guess, part of it. and then my nails too. Yeah, because I don't, I guess, things I don't notice. I don't notice doing that in probably, too. Understand. Especially if my legs are tired, still working on the phone. Okay. Do you want me to give you a referral to sleep medicine, or do you want to wait on that? Or at least, it's up to you. I mean, I could give it to you so a sleep doctor would evaluate your sleep oh Like, if you're having poor sleep, you know, I know they have doctors at JFK, poor sleep. If you want to be evaluated there. But the goal is to them to evaluate to make sure there's nothing medically going on that's causing you to have poor sleep and then to give you advice of how to improve your sleep. If you're like, you know... It's definitely, yeah, I take that help because I'm trying to forgot and mentally, you know. with it because it's like i work all day with the kids and i want to have time but i think it's time for me to go to sleep but i want to try that you know maybe watch tv or so that kind of probably keeps you know sure anything that could help with that um do you have difficulty in sleeping like initiating sleep like you just can't go to sleep right like that yeah it doesn't initiate like i probably i'll use your in the phone and sleep watching something like that all right Can you give urine today? You know, I had to use the bathroom earlier? Yes, I think that's just a... Okay. I don't know if that could have been, from my understanding, but that's the thing, from my understanding, but that's the thing, and that's the thing, and that's, you know, how many times how many times I could take it, you know, daily. I don't know if that could affect. You could, from my understanding, but that's the thing. If it's, Tums is one thing if you take it. It's only temporary. Yeah, but if you're having something that's, you know. And there's no way for them to see, right? Like, there's no way for them to find out something's. Oh, yeah, they can. Oh, they could. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So they do these testing. I definitely feel like, for sure. Yeah. It's something like it's not cool. I looked like a little animation things on lock. Okay, so if that doesn't shut back down and it's open i guess it'll come back up All right, so I put in two referrals. So one is for GI and one is for sleep. I'll probably say if you can, so the GI obviously, I probably would say, you know, look at GI first and that's sleep second in terms of you know but definitely like making sure you also get seen by the I mean I put in the referrals they should contact you. And then it's up to, I mean, I could, there's two options. Obviously, you can call your insurance and find out who is a GI doctor, right? That's under you. The other option obviously is that we have a group, not that's part of us, but who we sort of send our patients to for GI. If you want me to send you a referral there, that's up to you. The choice is yours. How far is that? They have many offices. I don't know exactly where, but I could send the referral and they can contact you. They would contact you, you know what I mean? And then they can, you can ask them what is close to you. Okay. All right, so I'll do that, then I'll send that. Then, I mean, you can still take the referral just in case, you know. Yeah, yeah. You could take the referral, but then, you know, work on getting, at least being evaluated, finding a sleep doctor under your insurance, and then they should contact you for the primary care. The doctor care is she does. At least that's, I mean, I've heard very good things about her, so that's why I'm saying that. But, you know, obviously you want to find something that fits with you. But getting a primary care is key. All right. All right. All right. So what we'll do is, so we have a lab here. We can have you do the blood work and everything here. They'll make sure that, you know, there's no issues from an insurance standpoint. And if there is, then they'll give you the scripts, and then you can go and do it in any lab. That is under your insurance, right? And then why don't we reconnect in about two weeks? Because I think by that time, you should have everything back. When you do give the urine, make sure it's midstream. What I mean by that is not the initials. urine that comes up but you let it go and then you give the same all right these will tell you to clean and everything or sometimes they forget but they may tell you um and uh but uh you want to also do that as well um just going back you know the if you want i mean because obviously when you did the screening test, your screening for depression was like between 10 and 14. If you want to talk to someone, you know, we can obviously try to set that up here if you're like, I want to talk to my, you know, see a primary first, then that's fine. No, I definitely see a primary first. Okay, all right. All right. All right, so I put in the blood work. Let's see what that shows. And then I'll probably see you back in two weeks because by that time I should have everything. Alright, so let me show you where the lab is. Go to the left. Thank you. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I'm sorry. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.

Patient is a non-smoking does not drink, it's employed, a single lives of its family. Hey, hey, how are you? Good, my name is Dr. Bodle. I have to meet you. All right, give me one second. Oh, okay. Yeah, she set me up to this one. Oh, okay. All right. All right. I don't know. I don't know. all right so i have you written that um do you have a family history of lupus is that correct or on your mother's side okay and it says you're having a joint pain or yeah i'm always missing but all my joint pains um they're just in pain constantly I get um I get sick and I notice, like, I don't get, like, a fever, but if I know when I'm sick, because I'm like the kids and everything, um, everything at once, even my, uh, the JFK hospital a long time ago diagnosed cost of congeritis. I said it wasn't a heart issue. Okay. So I, that would trigger, but I was able to, like, help help it out. I breathe. I drink water. And thankfully, before it gets like when I first experienced with the pressure on the chest okay um I get my migraines I had one last night um I see it's up for a lot of the wrists and so I used to play sports and um for example like now if I try to play basketball for like five minutes or something yeah I've tried to happen a while, but let's say months ago, I'll try, and I can't, for some reason, my lungs won't let me. I never had that feeling where I can't play a, you know, I used to be in teams back and put, you know, full courts, a lot of higher running, like, I could do that. And now I can't even, like, something's put in it. It's not like with the, I don't know if it's with the, the rib or the lungs, like I can't, for some reason I could puts me down. Like, I have to, have to breathe. So I'm thinking it has to do with lungs or pressure something. I just never knew what it was, but I just, like, stopped. I never, I would just maybe shoot something and everything that will never do, like, hard sports anymore. Has your primary care doctor, like, looked into all of this, or? I don't even, I don't even know where to get primary. have been known since I moved to Jersey back from New York. And I was 18, it was just like urgent cares. There's a lot of urgent cares. Okay. And I totally... on the shoulder on time they put the quarter zone yeah yeah yeah twice but um it's very like i want to get the best one i tried the one where i lived at but he wasn't taking any money like i telling him when my chest they didn't do no test is nothing and i'm like i can't go to something that doesn't you know all right i mean we have uh we have primary care i mean i could refer you refer you to, you know, the primary girl. Yeah, I could trust because I, I saw them they're going to take it seriously. They probably see me like I'm young, and I don't know, you know, I might look young or maybe in the 30s, but I feel like really weak. So I'm like, especially here, I have like a little, to me, like a little bump here. Okay. And I know my grandfather, um, for a past way while they had to cut off his leg, I don't know if we have diabetes or something like that. So I just, do you have any medical history of anything? I have scoliosis. Oh, you have scoliosis. Yes, scoliosis. I know that puts a lot of pressure. like that. All right. Do you have any medical history of anything? I have scoliosis. Oh, you have scoliosis. Yes, scoliosis. I know that puts a lot of pressure. are here, which probably cause... Do you have acid reflux? Yes, I do. Because sometimes acid reflux can cause... I mean, you know, you could get pain here. It could be silent. Do you have metallic taste in the morning when you wake up? Every day, like every night, like I take a thums. And sometimes if I fell asleep out of nowhere and I didn't take the thames, it'll come up I used to choke on my toe up and I get it really really bad it sucks I have to get to mention that. So that might, you know, so costucondritis is, you know, it's just like, there can be, so what by definition is like, okay, you know, if you're pressed in this area, you constantly have discomfort and pain, right? But sometimes what can be overlooked is things like acid reflux. So if you have acid acid reflux that can cause all that as well I mean that you know so cost with like in size like no longer closing it could be or you know it because I get it super fast like as soon as I laid down like even the water just wants to like thank them and so that's the thing it might be beneficial to I mean I could give you a referral to GI that's fine but the other thing is you know seeing a primary care can obviously deal at least so you need a primary care because they act like your quarterback right if you keep on going to specialists think of them as receivers, they just run up and down, but it's a quarterback that is deciding, okay, what we should do or what we should look at. You know what I mean? So that's the thing. But I can definitely at least, if you're telling me you have acid reflux and having metallic taste and if you're throwing up, then you should be at least seen by GI. You know what I mean? And I could give you a referral for that. I'm new to this area myself so um like I moved here 12 weeks ago so um so I don't know anyone specifically you know what I mean so that that's the only thing but I can definitely you know at least give you a referral for all right going back to your joint pain how long have you had that for I probably noticed it maybe three four or five years ago oh there But I remember, like, you know, some people say when you get 30. Yeah, yeah. Getting older, you feel older, joints here, all that stuff. But and I started looking like sure I really feel like this because I want to be active. I want to exercise. I want to do with this stuff but I definitely feel weaker. I see. You know, sometimes I get it, well mostly here, here. In your, all my, um. The P.A. The middle knuckles. You're right here. All of them right now. Just really, yeah, I would like squeeze them. them or you know what helps a lot that I notice is when I grab like either icy or like a cold soda can and I hold it even these areas like right now hurt and I hold in if I could feel all the like release I could feel like all the pain being released from the cold I see okay I just don't know how to deal with it I don't really I don't take many prescriptions I like to really there's like Tyone or Advil help I don't know I never really like took for it like I just deal with it I just let it I kind of got like used to it I guess I don't know if like I propose from Thailand or I have a little work. I can try it, you know, that just you to see it. I just let it, I kind of got, like, used to it, I guess. I don't know if, like, I propose from Thailand or I have it will work. I don't know. I can try it. Just you to see it. What happened to your nails? I guess like probably like biting it too loud. Oh, you're, okay, all right. You bite your nails, okay. In terms of, now these are just general questions. Like any ulcers in your mouth or anything like that? Like it, like, you know, you see an ulcer like this rough spot or anything no like that do you have any skin rashes No, no skin rashes like in your scalp or around your belly button. I don't see around the elbows or knees. Yeah, okay. Nothing around the butt crap or anything like that. Okay. Do you, obviously you told me about acid reflux, do you get, and you said you have shortness of breath, correct? Yeah, like if I play heavy sports. I guess I'm assuming it's probably jumping or lifting or whatever back. We do like in five minutes. Yeah. That triggered, though. Like, it's like something that pressured it. Okay. And I have to stop. I can't even. I see. You don't have, but do you get shortness of breath if you're just sitting or anything? No, no, no. No, nothing like that. Okay. Do you have any blood in your stool or blood in your urine? No. Do you have any? Do your fingertips, if you expose them to cold, do they turn anything like this? Just by any chance? No. Not that, or anything like that? No, okay. All right, so that's good. No brain on. Your sleep is? My sleep? Yeah. I have a horrible time sleeping in the night. For how long years? Oh yeah A very long time All right, all right. It's tough for me to go to sleep sometime. I use these migraine glasses sometimes to just kind of, like, help me. If it gets a little darker in the room, if I'm on the phone, just stop the lights from keeping me out. I see it. And it kind of helps me. But other than that, without. Have you ever seen a sleep doctor? No, I didn't. I know that's why it's important to see a primary care, you know what I mean? I got so much issues with you know. I didn't even. So that's why it's important to see a primary care. You know what I mean? I got so much issues with you. You know what to do with me. So the one thing, so how many hours do you sleep at night? Uh, I think it was not a good time. Last night, I was to take migraine pills. And, um, but normally it could be six hours, I'll say. Okay. But is it interrupted six or is it like? Yes, unfortunately. Sometimes if I get up at like two in the morning, I probably won't go to sleep a couple of hours and then I wake up so that could be bad. Okay. And I have to look up with the kids and work. I see. get up at like two in the morning. I probably went to sleep for a couple of hours and then I wake up so that could be bad. Okay. And I have to wake up with the kids and work. I see. Do you have anxiety or depression or anything like that? I don't know. I don't see like a therapist, anything like that, but I could say, yeah. I think I think I could have that anxiety and depression. Okay. Not as bad as just as me to probably see someone, I think, in my opinion, but, you know, sometimes people feel down. Okay. All right. Sometimes I'm happy. All right. Um. Let's see. You said no blood in the urine. No. No pain when you urinate or anything like that. You know, sometimes it's like, you know, you use the bathroom. It's hard sometimes to be a shout, so. Okay. But, you know, I'm sure, so. Do you have any, um, any numbness or tingling in your hands or feet? I don't even notice that when I'm sleeping, but I don't know if I'm sleeping wrong with my arm probably or my legs. It's hard to tell. It is, you know, so... It goes away if I, like, you know... Okay. Do you have it, like, during the day or anything like that? No, not that I recall. They're mostly in the night, so they didn't probably sleep. And when you sit at night, just in the legs or... Or in the hands? It would probably mostly in the hands. In the hands? the hands and a little bit of the arm. Okay. Okay. It's probably going to sleep position. I don't know this sometimes. All right. Um. hands and a little bit of the arm. Okay. Okay. It's probably going to sleep position. I don't know this sometimes. All right. But sometimes I do get, what I notice is when in the daytime, sometimes I will feel, like, you know, you feel your skin, but you can't, like, you touch your skin, but you can't feel it. Sometimes I get that feeling where, like, it feels weird, and tingling, but I don't know. All right, okay. It's, like, if I was sick or something. That's the only word that I'm afraid of, though. I see what that happens. Right now, okay. I mean, I have some information, at least things that you've done in the past. You know, at least blood work done from two years ago, at least was all normal. I don't know if any of, you know, this is just a while back, like I guess when you did it in January of 23. I never know of what. Okay of 23? Oh, I don't know if we're watching. Okay, alright. So, I mean, The only thing is, like, you know, from a lupus standpoint, and obviously we will evaluate you. But, like, looking at the blood work, at least that was done at that time, your urine was perfectly fine. You know, your cell counts, your white blood cell count, hemoglobin and platelet count, and your lymphocyte count, which are things that we look at, typically, because those are things that are affected in lus, we Okay. Um, your, you know, electrolytes, your sodium, I mean, your liver enzymes, everything, normal there as well so at least I don't have any you know I guess blood work wise yeah to suggest that there's anything going on the only thing you know my concern is when you were younger were you super flexible no flexible but I was very active you were very active or sports track okay okay all right you can't like touch your thumb to your forearm right like that can you like the back of the forearm No, no. No. It was all I played was basketball. Okay, all right. You can't, like, touch your thumb to your forearm or anything like that. Can you, like, the back of the forearm? No, no. No. Okay, okay, or the other side. I mean, you have to bend the wrist and then the back. No, no. No, okay. Okay, all right. I did read about it. It takes a while before you. Yeah, yeah, yeah. The only concern I have is just at least listening so far. So poor sleep can cause joint pain. Okay. So do you have brain fog? Like, you feel like you don't remember things oh that's why that's another thing i was gonna because i forget a lot i was supposed to write these things down yes uh recently i noticed that i had to write everything down my phone literally has all my work stuff that i i have to take in a daily basis yeah my calendar's completely full my notes is full i forget a lot now where like if we're from having a conversation i want to mention something for some reason just boom and have even like sometimes I know about car parts and I'm on my phone I can't remember now I remember a throttle body and I couldn't remember that it was completely blanked back in picture. Like, yeah, and that was like super bad for me because I was really good to remember a lot of things, and I was just, like, getting a lot. So that might all be related to poor sleep. So what happens is that when you don't sleep well, your brain doesn't relax, right? So sometimes people think, oh, I'm sleeping, but if they're snoring or if they're just, you know, tossing and turning, their brain is constantly on. You know what I? I mean, it's not relaxing. And so the way the brain communicates with you is through pain receptors, right? So the more you don't sleep well, the more pain you'll have. But then more pain you have, the more you won't sleep well. So it's a cycle that's hard to break. And then if you add anxiety and stress and depression into that, things just sort of explode explode but the reason why people get brain fog is because they're not resting their brain and that's another sign of that. And so that's why it's like, you know, I just question if maybe many of your symptoms could be related to sleep. You know what I mean? Of not sleeping well. Now, you said five years ago this is when all these symptoms started. At least I want to say I noticed. But prior to that, you were perfectly fine? Or did you still have symptoms? Like, I never had to, like, go to the doctor and get sick. I didn't, like, um, that's probably what, you know, that's where I didn't have primary care, I guess, you know, I'm supposed to check up, but when I really got sick, I never had any, like, you know, if I got injured, got cut, something when, you know, urgent care, sorry. But you did, thankfully, but did you have these symptoms prior to five years? Like, any of these, like, joint pain? It's tough to remember. I want to, I want to say, I don't know. Like I said, like said it crept up because I didn't notice it. I'm thinking, okay, you know, I could tolerate a lot of, like, high pain. You know, I got the cause of cartilage was one of the worst or migraines, one of the worst. So then you got these, you know, it's bothering me and I'm just, like, massaging it. Mm-hmm. And I never really thought of it, thinking just, okay, maybe it's just pain or something. You know, type, whatever. I guess it could be five it's more i really really can't remember i don't have anything to go back on The other question, any history of Lyme disease or anything like that have been, you have never been checked with Lyme or anything like, don't have you? No. All right. Any severe dry eyes or dry mouth? I do feel like I do get dehydrated pretty quick. Okay. I don't drink a lot of water too. I know that also may have to do with anything too. Okay. It's, uh, It's tough because, obviously, I'm trying to, the more of what I drink too, the acid reflex. Yes, yes, it's a fun. I'm trying to, like, try to drink those little ice cubes to help a little bit. And now, or just drink it in the room temperature. It might have more for me. Okay. Do you drink a lot? Do you have any diarrhea or anything like that? Uh, not in a daily basis. No, okay. Any easy bruising or anything like that? Like bruises you see, you're like, where did they come from? Or like that or not? No, thank you. No. No. I'm going to be. I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to be. I don't know. I want to try taking like a melatonin, but I think the five one it took was a little tough because I have the same kids too. Okay. It could get seizures, so she's on my maintenance and then my autistic son and my ID so it's smart for me to take something that's going to put me to sleep and I can't wake up to them I see. I'm a little afraid. I don't know, maybe one or a two. I don't know if you could help. I could still force myself well, but the five was just, I used to take the five mile back when I just had the one kid. I see. I used to help, but it's just, I can't even get up in the morning to feel like the trials in the whole day so it was not good in the morning. I would say, I mean, I would say, I mean, you could. It's a natural way, right, Melitone? There's the other things you could also do you could drink like warm glass of milk you know kiwis tend to help help you know you sleep but the thing is it's like if you're stressed out or have anxiety and stuff like that then you might not be able to you know what I mean and so that it's like a multi-prong approach meaning that okay let's say if I said if you go to a sleep doctor He'll be like, okay, let's say if I said, if you go to a sleep doctor, he'll be like, okay, let's just check, you make sure you don't have sleep apnea, rest of leg, things like that, right? And then it's like, okay, so you don't have anything medical, but you don't sleep well, right? But if, let's say your anxiety is not under control or something, or like, you know, you're a lot of under stress, obviously that is going to play a role in not, of you not sleeping well. So that's the thing, and so that's why it's like a multi-prong approach of, okay, like, you know, doing a couple of things at the same time. um to try to get your sleep better my feeling is if if your sleep does get better then i think many symptoms might actually get better you know what i mean specifically as a brain fog yeah yeah because i have to put like foam and everything like making more so yeah yeah and so that that's the thing it's it you know a lot of symptoms can be related to just poor sleep. It is like, it is like eight hours a minimum. It is as long as you, but, yeah, so as long as it's not interrupted, right? And the thing is making sure that you have been ruled out for, like, sleep me and things like that um yeah like this morning all the kids jumped in the the night and i'm like i even know when i was there and then the other one kid i just sleep on the opposite side of the they got the bunk bed so i can't even go on there's um so yeah definitely is like a little interruption all right you can take out your shoes and socks for me and your hat as well. Thank you. Yeah, I know when I go to sleep, I go to massage thing, in Menlo-a-Moh, I don't know, I know you can move with kid, there's one in Menlo-Mole, they do massage, I'll tell the lady just to focus on the lights, and I hadn't had that in, like, months, and it was the most painful, but, like, she took all that pain away, that heaviness, like, that, like, that felt heaviness, she took all that with a sergeant, it was so painful, though, because it's like... Doing it? Yeah, but it... that pain away that heaviness she took all that away with a sergeant I was like oh my it was so painful though it's like doing it yeah but it like took all the relief so it was like both at the same time let me ask you this like i don't know if you look at things like this but i was trying to like am i the one feeling this or not or it's just me was it the muscle or because like i always like either it grew a little bit more like a little bold there or went small then um alba noticed at one point it's all finally somebody then my 15-year-old daughter noticed okay i'm not going crazy but it's like not going to the point like it's like you mean right here yeah it's around like and that's where it always hurts when I try to massage. It could be a muscle knot. Oh, okay. You know what I mean? If that's what you're talking about. Yeah. And I thankfully haven't had a cramp in a while, like they would try to sneak up. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Because things are painful in the calf. But this side definitely doesn't, like, you know, and you can tell, like, right, right here is where exactly I want to, like, always I'm sorry. Over your mouth. Like, you know, I need to tell, like, right, right here is where exactly I want to, like, always have to start. Over your mouth. Tune up. Tip your head up. Look down to me. Open your eyes. Look up here. You've had your thyroid checked and everything. Oh, what's that? I'm sorry. Do I say your thyroid gland? Does anyone check? Well, I assume not. Who in the family has lupus? My mother. You said your mother. She's in Russia. Okay. All right. Deep breaths in it up. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Any pain where I push? No. Any pain back here, down here when I push? No. Any pain up here when I push? Yeah, this pain. Oh, in these two areas. Yeah. And then down here? No, not right now, yeah. Here it does hurt. Yeah. Is I here when I do this? No. Any discomfort when I do that? Or this? No. I like for some reason, like I like pressure. Like, I put my hand on the pillow and I need, like, pressure on anything. Like, I don't mind. Pressure. Are you pain or discomfort when I do this? No. If your kids hug you, like, quickly, like, don't touch me? No, no, I can't wait. Okay. Maybe mom is after a few hours in dealing with... Do you pain when I do that? No, no, thankfully. Yeah, I guess the elbows is probably the least because I'm not walking on that. That's why these were at the moment. Any pain right push? Yeah, just like I could feel. Sightly? But it's like only on the sides. I know it's like going with those yeah but only the middle is This one hurt when I do that or not? Yeah, usually the middle ones hurt the most, but all of them show. Like, you know, like, pain, like, to me, it's like when I squeeze it, it feels like... It's supposed to be pain, I guess, but it feels like I'm trying to put the pressure off. All right, let it go. Any pain, I do that? No, but I just get pain here, like I want to, like, squeeze exactly what you're doing. I have both palms for some reason. I don't know what that has to do with the thumb. No, but I just get pain here, like I want to like squeeze exactly what you're doing. Both palms for some reason. I don't know what that has to do with the thumb. Any numbness or tingling when I do this? No. No. I mean if there's any pain where I push. No pain when I do that? No, no, probably. Not like that like any dumb pain. Okay. You feel like a little bit of it, but it's not like the spring pain. All right. And these are all you're chewing on these nails? Yeah. All right. It's like automatic, I don't even know. I'm doing this sometimes. Okay. Okay. Any're not there yet. Any pain when I do that? No. I guess she had an induction. Are you pain where I push? No. Okay. Okay. Let me back. Let me for a second. Bend this knee. Any pain when I do that? No. Okay. Bend it. Rotated up? Any pain in the hips or anything? Yeah, that's the main ones that I always try to stretch. Right there? Yeah, like, I guess my father has sciatica, so he said it could be sciatica, too. But I try to do that stretch where you bring it over. Okay. I stretch it, because that's the worst part, I guess, because I sit a lot for work. Any pain in the back when I do this? Or nothing? No, No. Let's check the opposite. I'm just knee. Any pain when I do that? No. Any pain when I do that? do this? No, I see me. Any pain when I... Nothing like that? Just beside the muscle. Okay. Does it hurt when I push right here? It's... It's what the bones are right. Right here? Yeah, unfortunately. So it's hard to say what that could be, do you do? I do sit a lot. You do. So if you have scoliosis, it can come from the back, that is what we call. all of the trochanter bursa region. So sometimes people say, oh, I have a bursitis. There's no joint there, right? Our hip joint is in our groin area. This right here is basically where you have the shaft of the femur, right? On top of that, you have a liquid sack, and on top of that is the muscle. So what happens is that if the muscle was just on top of the bone then obviously the bone would shred the muscle apart. So that fluid sac allows the muscle to smoothly glide over the bone. But you can get pain in that area, and that's why they call that the trochentric bursa region, or bursitis. But you don't know if it's actually the bursa that's inflamed, or if you have a tendinitis or a tendonopathy, or if it can be pain coming from the back. Being that it's on both, it's not, sciatic pain would be shooting pain going from the back down the leg. So, But this might be just, you know, more of a tendinopathy. And stretching stuff like that is helpful. I mean, I could obviously send you to physical therapy for that. But if you're like, no, you know, I know what I'm doing, that's fine. But I tend to send patients to physical therapy if they have a lot of issues. And if it's still hurts, you can get those areas injected typically done by orthopedics or sports medicines. Right, you can get those areas injected, typically done by orthopedics or sports medicines. All right, you can get back. Go ahead, you put on your shoes, I'm sorry. So clinically, I don't see signs of lupus. My concern is just like, so we'll do a complete workup anyways, right, from a rheumatological sense. You know, I'm going to check you for everything um not just only you know um you know, the general markers, but I'm also going to check you for specific markers for lupus to see if there's anything that is there. But clinically I don't see anything. The one thing I tell patients is that, look, you know, it's not all on blood work, right? Because all these diseases have a criteria. And you have to, you know, it's one thing, you know, and for these criteria for these diseases it's like you have to meet a clinical and a blood work blood work criteria you know what I mean but at least so far and then how we make a diagnosis is based on history your physical exam and blood work and do they all match up right I've had some patients who might have a marker positive but they don't have any clinical findings right now your symptoms are a bit non-specific right but you know like what I was looking for, I'm like, all right, obviously you have had an echo done in the past, at least I got that information. And there's no, like, you know, fluid around your heart, in your lungs or anything like that, things that we would see with lupus. Obviously, I don't see any severe rashes. I don't see any ulcers in your mouth. I don't see significant swelling or anything like that, right? Your joints feel normal to me. So I don't see any overt signs of lupus. Obviously, blood work done in the past has been normal. But we will make sure that we have checked everything. to me. So I don't see any overt signs of lupus. Obviously, blood work done in the past has been normal, but we will make sure that we have checked everything. I'm also going to check, you know, what we consider, like, non-rumatological. So I'm going to check your thyroid and make sure that is okay. All right. And then... I don't know. And if you would like, uh, hold on, hold on. I don't know So, like I said, I'm going to check you for non-rubatological as well, and what I mean by that is, I'm going to check you for non-rubatological as well. And what I mean by that is I'm going to check your thyroid. But check you for Lyme disease, make sure you don't have that. Sometimes people might have Lyme disease and can cause similar symptoms. You know what I mean? So if you have never been checked for that, that's one thing. I'm going to give you a referral to GI because if you really have badass reflux where you're throwing up, then I think that should be evaluated. The last person just told me to take the over-the-counter. Pepsit? But it was no good for me. I was getting itchy through. I never know I was allergic to it. Yeah. Until I think when I was taking it, it was so itchy. So I didn't even was allergic to it. Yeah. Until I think when I was taking it, it was so itchy. So I didn't think it could be. Yeah, no, I mean, and so that's why I think seeing a specialist might be helpful for that perspective. In terms of a primary care, there is, I mean, I don't know where her office is located. There's a Dr. Caracetas that people are happy. with, you know, um, I could definitely refer you to her, you know, um, you know, um, you know, just so you have someone to look at, maybe some of your other symptoms, you know what I mean? Because obviously it's sort of beyond my expert, or at least by, you know, um, yeah, yeah, um, so, um, so, so, because for me, the, the thing is, you you know you might have what we call chronic fatigue syndrome or Chronic pain syndrome, which are basically things, or at least what we consider them as diseases, are where people have chronic pain or chronic fatigue. And, you know, it's, there isn't great treatment for it, but you try to, you know, treat the symptoms to the best of your ability. But like I said, it's a multi-prong approach. So, and what makes me say that is because you're saying if you have chronic pain or I've had these symptoms for more than five years you get tired easily you're not sleeping well your brain fog and then you have these non-specific you know joint pain but clinically it's like i don't see anything you know what i mean and so we sometimes define that as okay that could be chronic pain but that is a diagnosis of exclusion and what i mean by that is that we first rule everything out and then i could say that but just listening to your history that's what it sounds like you know what I mean? Sometimes I don't even notice the stuff until like and like, you know, just thinking like it's normal, like, yeah, yeah, stuff. I mean, some could be, some of it could be, but I think the crux of the two things that you said that would make me be like, okay, that these two are issues is the sleep not being well, and if you're having a lot of anxiety, those two things can play a role in making you feel the way you are. So that's the thing. And so if that's the case, then treating those two things is important, you know, regardless of what the lab shows. You know what I mean? Like, you know, if your thyroid is abnormal, sure, we can send you to a thyroid specialist and things like that. But at the end, it's like, or your primary, you know, the primary care doctor can take care of it as well but Do you feel you are, you have any depression right now, like that, or not so much where you're like, no, not now, but? No, I think it only happens in like, sorry, like, you know, I think it would trigger like a sad event or something. something, you know, just to do something, but, you know, I try to keep a positive mind all the time. I think, it's hard because I, I, no way to really diagnose myself in without a profession, but I think it could be it because, um, I notice someone on the phone, I can't stay still. I hope thank you for, if we have to, yeah, yeah, I noticed that, I've never had a profession, but I think it could be it because I noticed I'm on the phone, I can't stay still. I hope that's for it. Yeah, yeah. I noticed that, I guess, part of it. and then my nails too. Yeah, because I don't, I guess, things I don't notice. I don't notice doing that in probably, too. Understand. Especially if my legs are tired, still working on the phone. Okay. Do you want me to give you a referral to sleep medicine, or do you want to wait on that? Or at least, it's up to you. I mean, I could give it to you so a sleep doctor would evaluate your sleep oh Like, if you're having poor sleep, you know, I know they have doctors at JFK, poor sleep. If you want to be evaluated there. But the goal is to them to evaluate to make sure there's nothing medically going on that's causing you to have poor sleep and then to give you advice of how to improve your sleep. If you're like, you know... It's definitely, yeah, I take that help because I'm trying to forgot and mentally, you know. with it because it's like i work all day with the kids and i want to have time but i think it's time for me to go to sleep but i want to try that you know maybe watch tv or so that kind of probably keeps you know sure anything that could help with that um do you have difficulty in sleeping like initiating sleep like you just can't go to sleep right like that yeah it doesn't initiate like i probably i'll use your in the phone and sleep watching something like that all right Can you give urine today? You know, I had to use the bathroom earlier? Yes, I think that's just a... Okay. I don't know if that could have been, from my understanding, but that's the thing, from my understanding, but that's the thing, and that's the thing, and that's, you know, how many times how many times I could take it, you know, daily. I don't know if that could affect. You could, from my understanding, but that's the thing. If it's, Tums is one thing if you take it. It's only temporary. Yeah, but if you're having something that's, you know. And there's no way for them to see, right? Like, there's no way for them to find out something's. Oh, yeah, they can. Oh, they could. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So they do these testing. I definitely feel like, for sure. Yeah. It's something like it's not cool. I looked like a little animation things on lock. Okay, so if that doesn't shut back down and it's open i guess it'll come back up All right, so I put in two referrals. So one is for GI and one is for sleep. I'll probably say if you can, so the GI obviously, I probably would say, you know, look at GI first and that's sleep second in terms of you know but definitely like making sure you also get seen by the I mean I put in the referrals they should contact you. And then it's up to, I mean, I could, there's two options. Obviously, you can call your insurance and find out who is a GI doctor, right? That's under you. The other option obviously is that we have a group, not that's part of us, but who we sort of send our patients to for GI. If you want me to send you a referral there, that's up to you. The choice is yours. How far is that? They have many offices. I don't know exactly where, but I could send the referral and they can contact you. They would contact you, you know what I mean? And then they can, you can ask them what is close to you. Okay. All right, so I'll do that, then I'll send that. Then, I mean, you can still take the referral just in case, you know. Yeah, yeah. You could take the referral, but then, you know, work on getting, at least being evaluated, finding a sleep doctor under your insurance, and then they should contact you for the primary care. The doctor care is she does. At least that's, I mean, I've heard very good things about her, so that's why I'm saying that. But, you know, obviously you want to find something that fits with you. But getting a primary care is key. All right. All right. All right. So what we'll do is, so we have a lab here. We can have you do the blood work and everything here. They'll make sure that, you know, there's no issues from an insurance standpoint. And if there is, then they'll give you the scripts, and then you can go and do it in any lab. That is under your insurance, right? And then why don't we reconnect in about two weeks? Because I think by that time, you should have everything back. When you do give the urine, make sure it's midstream. What I mean by that is not the initials. urine that comes up but you let it go and then you give the same all right these will tell you to clean and everything or sometimes they forget but they may tell you um and uh but uh you want to also do that as well um just going back you know the if you want i mean because obviously when you did the screening test, your screening for depression was like between 10 and 14. If you want to talk to someone, you know, we can obviously try to set that up here if you're like, I want to talk to my, you know, see a primary first, then that's fine. No, I definitely see a primary first. Okay, all right. All right. All right, so I put in the blood work. Let's see what that shows. And then I'll probably see you back in two weeks because by that time I should have everything. Alright, so let me show you where the lab is. Go to the left. Thank you. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I'm sorry. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Mr. Charles Gibbs is a 74-year-old male presenting for his first rheumatology evaluation. He reports a history of right knee problems for ""a few decades"" with progressive decline in function. Six years ago, he was nearly scheduled for knee replacement surgery but was advised by his physical therapist that he could potentially delay surgery with appropriate management. Patient reports that his right knee pain is currently mild (2.5/10) at rest with no pain while sitting. Pain increases with certain activities, particularly when ""coming down the wrong way"" and can reach 4-5/10 at which point he backs off activity. He notes limitations in his ability to bike as he used to, though he maintains an exercise regimen including riding a stationary bike 3 times weekly for 20 minutes. He practices two different schools of Tai Chi and performs strengthening and stretching exercises.Patient also reports bilateral shoulder pain described as ""creepy shoulders"" for approximately 7 years. He was previously evaluated by an orthopedist in Maryland who reviewed x-rays of his knees and shoulders and concluded he was ""a great candidate for surgery in all joints"" but he has been managing conservatively.Of note, in 2020, the patient experienced an episode of migratory joint pain that began with tightness in his right groin, then moved to his hip, and subsequently affected both shoulders. The shoulder pain was severe, making it difficult to put on shirts or lie down in bed, described as feeling ""like someone was sticking needles in my shoulders."" This occurred during early COVID pandemic, and he managed with self-directed physical therapy. By the time he was able to see a physician, symptoms had resolved, and blood work showed no inflammatory markers. This constellation of symptoms has not recurred.Patient had arthroscopic surgery on his left knee ""a long time ago"" which he states ""put me off surgery forever if I can avoid it."" He reports an episode approximately 10 years ago (2015) when his left knee locked after sitting cross-legged to meditate, and he was unable to unlock it for about 5 days. Records indicate ""a large lateral meniscus tear with a displaced fragment and medial meniscus"" at that time, but he declined surgery.Previous imaging from 2020 in Houston reportedly showed osteoarthritis of the right knee. Patient is currently working with a physical therapist at Atlantic Physical Therapy.

INTERVAL HISTORY:
7/10/2025: Patient returns for follow-up after labs and imaging were ordered at previous visit on 6/5/2025. Patient reports pain level of 0-1/10 in bilateral knees and shoulders. Patient continues to practice Tai Chi and performs regular exercises. Patient reports playing recreational activities including badminton and croquet with grandchildren.

Ordered some blood work and x-rays. And I'm looking to see the lab results. 6525, yes, I've reviewed them so cbc looking good kidney liver function test good uric acid good markers of inflammation good that is normal uric acid is 5.9 vitamin d is 57.4 b12 garlic acid is where it should be 559 and more than 20 number 12 factor is negative as I said kidney liver function test was normal glucose is 127 slightly elevated but I wouldn't worry about it because this is a random And the understanding of doing this blood work was not to diagnose diabetes. It was to work for other aspects and everything looks pretty good there. Okay, so systemically speaking, we don't have any evidence of inflammatory arthritis. That's important to note. Okay. Uh Let's see where my anti CCP is. There's reporting the same thing. Okay. And now looking at the radiology. 6.925, we have x-ray of the radiology. We have x-ray of the shoulder which it was which came back as this bilateral shoulders came back as normal study so no abnormality detected from a skeletal skeleton viewpoint of course it doesn't reflect it doesn't comment on the soft tissues and then we have bilateral knees and it says dry compartmental always present in the right knee which is more marked in the compartment small joint effusion is present left knee is read as minimal osteoarthritis with small joint and small joint effusion cannot be excluded is the small amount of fluid excuse me yeah it's funny I'm sitting by myself and I don't want I'm with a patient and I'm on poor performance well I do something Okay, so fill me in. Tell me how are things today. I know we were, I'm going back to my notes as you were walking in. I was reviewing where we left off last, six, five, twenty five, and there was an evaluation and management of right knee pain and bilateral shoulder pain, and it looks like the shoulders were red as normal and he was nearly scheduled for knee replacement surgery. was advised by his physical therapist that he could potentially delay surgery with appropriate management and that's how we met right so right knee is currently mild 2.2 and a half out of 10 at rest with no pain while sitting and he practices Tai Chi and strengthening exercises correct okay is it similar okay his imaging in Houston reportedly showed osteoarthrenness of the right knee currently working with a physical therapist Atlantic physical therapy sticking needles in my shoulder is how he described it difficult to put on shirts and lie down on bed it offered during early COVID pandemic self-directed physical therapy until you know until now is sort of getting some professional help for this uh so we ordered the needs in this blood work we saw physical therapy i said we should continue uh over-the-counter medication was was fine is that is that all that you've required so far or yeah okay and i said discuss the option of low-nosed pain medication and bedtime with pain increases noting potential side effects of sleepiness i'm maybe referring to what is called geloxetine dose and then we have interested in gel shots to bilateral needs both of a corticosteroid as a patient pain is not severe and follow up in four weeks so based on the on the x-rays that we are looking at two things the first is the right knee definitely needs a photo bone injection and once we do the cortisone injection will present the approval for the gel shots. The approval for the gel shots needs a prior forezone injection and I'll tell you why. Because the way the insurances work they go by step edit, meaning what if you try it feels? All right, and the jill shots only get a proof if you try this drug before the injection. To me, trying and failing is not as important and getting it done and climbing for it. Meaning you sort of set the knee up for success when you do a joe shot. The joe shot should follow soon enough. I mean, I shouldn't wait like six months for the joe shot to happen and do a form of injection today. Okay? Um, yes, people use a code and injection in the office. We do not require any prior approval by the requirements as you do the codecum injection. Uh, post injection is such as a very simple and ice a side of injection five minutes, which I'm sitting there. Okay. You know, whatever you the player. You can all... definitely you do it at tai chi because knowing what tai chi is or the other chi gun yeah it's q i that's the chi gong gong g gong gong okay okay there's a lot of gongcha in my area yeah yeah yeah it's all it's you know the big thing yeah gongcha is a drink that they drink is that bubble tea oh yeah yeah okay so um only because it's so low impact and it's nothing that would harm you're so but basically if you were scheduled to do something like this today I don't have any limitations to that but typically I let my patients take it easy for the day they get the injections meaning let's not be cooking like a three-hour meal or a few gallons of milk and up and down steps into the grocery so you know it's just not a day for bed rest but definitely to take it easy a little bit no bad met no my brain got it yeah say that again No badminton with my grandmother. Madminton, yeah. Badminton is, I would take it easy for today. Yeah, I don't know what the weather looks like. It's supposed to rain call. Really? And it hasn't started yet. Okay. You know, that's the way the forecast shows like we'll never see this Sunday again. I mean, we're going to be rain, rain, and the rain doesn't come, and the sun comes out and stuff. I know, it's tricky. Only because, you know, this is a track of part. So for most surgeons, we would get very happy about it to do surgery into the right knee for sure. It is, it is, it is... It's a tri-compartmental or it means that the knee has got four compartments of which three compartments have definitely involved. And the fourth compartment is a poplito pasta, it's the most compartment that typically does not get involved. So everything that can be involved is involved. And so when you say it's involved. It is showing signs of pathology. It's showing signs of arthritis, present, moderate to severe, cortisone injection. To be quite honest, in the world where gel shots may not get approved, cortis would be enough also. I only push for the gel shots because if the choice is one to cover it. is by far the best standard of care can offer you. But we definitely don't fall short if we were to leave it at a horizontal projection also. So I know you don't have a crystal ball. Right, right. But if you were to imagine you had a little bit of one, how does this play out over the years? Yeah, so that's the reason why I sort of say, let's do aggressive management today because we want to change the poor facilities. Okay. today we did it. rest and say, you'll just go home, do our exercise and take time and all that is needed. We do not really change the course of disease. Okay. So if you change the course of the disease, you have to have active management. And this is how far I go with active management. You know, first you no harm and then it takes only what's broken. And that's maybe where it is. Okay. So I'm going to stay away from all medication if I have to. That's true, yeah. Yeah, and I'm a stay away from all medication if I possibly can, so I will trust your professional judgment if you feel cortisone is, it's not something I would say yes to easily, but if you feel that's the best course at this point, I'm willing to give it a try. Perfect. I think today is a good day we should go ahead and do it. Excuse me, the other piece was Shoulder support which we have not discussed yet. They have been symptomatic. They have been read as normal. Nothing that we've not seen before. In a situation like this, I choose one or the other that is right or the left and get an MRI and then up the shoulder. Okay. Only with the intention of documenting what we, what we've seen clinically. It only helps us to get things approved moving forward. Thank you. I don't know if that is MRI, I think that. It says right D. Oh, and also say the shoulder. Yeah. August 30, 2018. Yeah. Is that an MRI or an extra? Well, that's what I don't know. Okay, what should it say in here? Radiology. It's a D MRI and the shoulder MRI. Okay, fantastic. Very good, that's exactly what I was looking here. So that might. Yes, I'm going to call this place. This is it. This is it. Maryland okay same time don't right okay so it should be open now yeah let's be off on the table let's see how we've been 2018 today's 2025 so seven years seven years okay we're right back yep Oh, I also need to put in a motor for Deppo. What, 10 to you see in the day? 10 to 15. It's a lot, but not, I don't know, too much. No, it's, in my opinion, it's not too much, yet it fills up my day. Yeah, I'm not sure. I'm here until 6, so, yeah. Oh. Oh. I am keeping an arbitrarily a follow-up visit for four weeks from today, just with the intention that we, if you get the Georgia as approved, we should be able to see other then okay uh so that's something else good to out there yes exactly and uh so today's visit we're doing depplement roll the large joint and uh and uh And confirm with me, if we're gonna do both these while we do, if the Jolshaws do get approved? Well, my left me doesn't. Bother you? Yeah, it doesn't. It seems fine. However, it is showing mild cases of mild signs. of arthritis compared to the other knee it's definitely it the process is there in my opinion i think if you were to do shots we should do it both so we don't see any problems we don't have to go forward for this guy at all for that knee and only the gel shots which have no real side effects so the right knees okay so i'll put in a request for both and be right with you now Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I don't know. I'm going to be. I don't know. We're going to be. We're going to be. We're going to be. We're going to be able to be. You know? It was a . I'm a . Okay, so they're working on this. This is Deppermedro. Okay. Okay, so it's an introtic in a steroid preparation. Everybody would do the same, ortho, room, sports medicine. So it's just going to be disqualifying from the Olympics. Yeah, no way. Yeah, I have, you know, it's really interesting. I have yet to read on it in depth, because of course I know this part of the sphere well, But I don't know how they, they graduate, use a steroid in an athlete. And if your knees hurting, you will get a steroid injection. It's like disqualify you, but you're only treating her injury. Yeah. So, I can't get it. Or you're taking it to boost your energy level? Yeah. You know what it is? Okay. Well, in muscle mass, you know, that in the baseball steroid era, that was a big thing. But which should... Is it because my patient getting steroids out to lose muscle mass, gain body fat, don't look good. Definitely don't look like an athlete if they're on it as well. Yeah, that's not my area of expertise. But we lived in the Bay Area back in the day when the steroid football was heating up in very bonds. And then he considered the greatest player of that era was accused of taking steroids. So, although he... never tested positive for them. And you could see, you know, if you just put pictures of them side by side how his body mass bulked up. But what people say is the things he could do, you know, his eye, his reflex, steroids don't affect that. But he's the all-time leader in home runs and other things. probably never get elected to the baseball Hall of Fame because even though he was, again, never tested positive and he actually was put on trial and acquitted, but. No, does it buy them? There you go. Okay. I'm guessing that we don't do that through my pants. No. But you're wearing the right clothing. So let me call it. Just bring it forward a little bit to the break of the bed, that's good enough for me. Okay. Okay, and... Okay, here we are. How do I get to say ouch? It's up to you. Well, I don't think that's what we will encounter, but yeah, it's an experience. If I'm going to say, ouch, I can. Of course, freedom of speech. Okay. Well, let's hang on to it as long as we can. So this is the medial joint space, that's really the biggest brunt of austral resistance here. Okay. So this is the lateral joint space. Mm-hmm. So this is the lateral joint space. So medium and lateral. Okay. the protection of tomorrow or which I'm good. the Gap, which we typically don't access. Unless with the swelling or is a fluid there. It's simple for me, but I'm trying to look for it is any fluid in this need today because it didn't mention a join the fusion on the X-ray. I don't feel I need here. Everything needs to be charged. Yeah, everyone is charged for some. Oh, there is... Sorry about that. So the purpose of getting an ultrasound. So the purpose of getting an ultrasound the room is to get a bedside assessment of what we're up against. You know, it's not people who are going to do an extra an MRI. The idea of a bedside assessment is to make sure we're not dealing with any acute swelling. Not to make compromise needs need an ultrasound regarding the injection for the most part. Well, I didn't even more than capable of him. I'm saying to trust that completely. Thank you. I appreciate that. So why do you see? No, it's not with me. You said you play, uh, did you play? maybe you could just exercise as much exercise I exercise I play games like cribbage oh yeah okay table and our grand children are here 13 brain twins so I play badminton oh yeah that's our granddaughter and croquet so who's a badminton Well, when I was younger, I played a lot of them. We have a set that hasn't met that even played them and they're volleyball. Okay, yeah. Our granddaughter and grandson hit the volleyball back and forth with each other. Mm-hmm. Our granddaughter and I have that birdie around. Yeah. I think it happens in Badminton and volleyball is sort of versatile sports, so you can sort of set them up wherever. Absolutely. Well, in Croquet too. Prok? How do you play Koke? In croquet, you have two sticks at either end of the course and two wickets in front and then two on the sides, one of the middle two on the side. So you start on one end and you have a mallet and a ball and you hit the ball through the first two wickets, then go out. to make it stand there. the side to the middle to the side uh-huh to the two wickets in the stick on the other and then come back through on the other side interesting you play with uh you know as many people want to play wow i should look up a video to see how it's it's fun and you know formally the people who play it formally you know you have a perfectly manicured croaked blonde and all this stuff we really kind of part of the joy and challenge is having a bumpy yard and being behind the tree and on the hill. So you can put up a croquet set anywhere you want. I see. I see. Yeah. But it's, you know, unless you're the mall or the mallet head, it's a low impact sport. It's a little. Very good. Yes, I see what you see. And you have everyone outdoors, you know, in the backyard and moving around a little. Yes. Yes, no room for boredom, I like that. Yeah, I've played ProK since I was a little boy and had them too. They just carry on the tradition. That's real good. Yeah. It does sound like an interesting game. It sort of is an offshoot of what we already know is that about hockey versus. Would you say it's like a hockey? Well, it's... Less players though. You... It's one at a time. time each person has their own ball and their own mallet. I see. So it's more like golf that way. Okay, I see what you're saying. So instead of 18 holes, you've got two, four, and the nine wickets. Uh-huh. So what are you up against time? No, no. You play against each other. So, you know, obviously you go one at a time. We do things like, okay, from the youngest goes first, the oldest goes last, or you can have everyone line up and hit their balls toward the post. and the closest goes first and then you just play and you know the idea is you if you want to win if you care about that you want to be the first one to complete the course i see and we used to play the way i grew up was the first one who completed the course and hit the post got to be poisoned and that meant if that person's ball hit anyone else's ball, they were automatically out. So the game would end with everyone eliminated but won. And then about a year ago, we were playing in our daughter for the first time in their life won. And she said, this is the first time I've ever gotten to complete the course. And I thought, well, that's not right. So I outlawed poison. I said, we're not going to play that anymore when the first person finishes that person's done and everyone else can keep on playing if they don't want to they don't have to but everyone else can keep on playing until they're done okay so everyone gets the experience of doing the whole course yes yes and I think that would keep all the arguments of the field right yeah it annoyed our son who's often winning and he did like that I made a unilateral rule that way, but you'll get used to it. I'll be right back, okay? I'll be here. Okay. I'm just getting myself in a little bit. Yeah, I have to throw them away, so I have none in the back now. Thank you. Surprise. It's like, you know, keeping track of your groceries, making sure something is on the shore. Yeah, yeah, it's always good to have that backup. I'm guessing for you, even more important. So you can run around the corner and get some of that backup. Not this one, yeah. Close way. So the way we do this is I take a picture, which I just did. Clean it, love it with the loving thread, and go in with the nails. Go ahead. Pushing the medicine. Mm-hmm. I don't need to say how she is. Okay, we're almost done, bringing myself out. Perfect. I see the side of injection, five minutes two times today, they're after you're going to have got a heat or whatever you prefer. Okay. Okay. Five minutes, two times today. Correct. Yep. And I never get to go play soccer or over. Even bad minutes. So I'll have to be a couch potato. Our grand twins and I are about not even a third of the way in of a series based on a series of books that I read first to our daughter when she was a little. Really? Which one is that? Well, it's, the series is called His Dark Materials. Okay. The three books, and that's from a quote from Milton. The three books are called The Golden Compass, the Amber Spy Glass, and the Golden Compass, Subtle Knife, Amber Spy Glass. The protagonist of the Golden Compass is a young girl, young woman right on the cusp of puberty. And she's an amazing character. character. The book plays around with multiple universes and the subtle knife in the second book is an implement that can actually open a scene that allows the person who cuts it to move from one universe to another or one world to another. So the other protagonist is a young boy about the same age and they both live in Oxford but in different worlds. But they end up coming to together in the second book and you know it's it's a fantasy there are armored bears in the the Oxford that the girl lives in Lyra is her name everyone has a demon that is an external manifestation of their soul until puberty the demon can be any shape it wants any time and if puberty is it settles and becomes the shape for the rest of your life. Wow. In the Oxford, the boy is from, they don't have demons outside visible like that. So the question is where is their soul? You know, it's a rousing adventure story, but with some deep, deep theology, you know, the, you know, the best, the sort of bad guys are called the magisterium and it's basically a religious hierarchy that tries to dictate everything to everyone and says this is allowed that's not allowed and where do you find this in Netflix yeah well the the series is on max max which used to be B.M. Okay, okay, got it. But the books too, I don't know. I don't know how old. You have kids? Yes, I do. So middle school, high schoolers. Middle school? Yes, yes. This is good food for power. The golden compass. Sure. The first one. Yeah. Our grandson was 13 now. He said halfway through the third book. Fantastic. I'll definitely get a hold of Yeah, they're great. Yeah. Actually, the authors... going on to write while we're waiting for the third and the second trilogy. The first one was a prequel, and the second was the sequel to the three that were first published. And I've been waiting for about three years for the third one. Really? It keeps saying it's just about done. So it is the process. Okay, very good. I thought the other things of the past, but now they're still very much active, working on that. So Charles, what I have here for you is, this is the surface of your knee, all right, hardly any joint space. So this is definitely well deserved. And I have already put in order for orthodox, for me. Orthovesque is a joll shot that I know the office has procured and we like to use them as first time. However, if insurance does not approve it, we'll just choose whatever is on their formula. So that is something that will work its way and you will get letters. as correspondents explaining where we are with the approval process. I'm saving this to your chart, which I just did. No medications from me. A follow-up in four weeks. We reviewed the x-rays and the blood work. I have yet to see that MRI that comes through. The staff is working on it. I know it may take anywhere between 15 minutes to two hours, depending on when it does pop up. But we will stay in touch with the approval for the gel shots because that's the next thing on my list of things to do. All right. And you can always, you know, feel free to call the office and get an update if there are any questions. I have one other question. Do you have any experience with and or opinion of hyperbaric oxygen chambers? For osteoarthritis? For just helping regenerate in the body. Okay. So I have heard, I've never, I've never used one or prescribed one, but I have read on hyperbaric oxygen chambers for wound management. and that's how far I read it okay well I've actually used okay and when I told my doctor that I was thinking about gel shots he said well I would suggest before you get the gel shots have a couple of sessions in the oxygen chamber and after the gel shot have a couple because that will help that be more effective I never heard that before as pre, a prelude and sort of, you know, no. Other than a horizontal injection, which we just did, and I wouldn't even know where to find it. Well, I'm going to be a guinea pig. You prefer to, okay. And give that a try. Okay. Just because, as I say, I've done the hyperbaric oxygen chain. And it's just in terms of the way I've, afterwards. It was good. And where did you find it? Well, my primary theater is the principal integrated health. Uh-huh. Over on whatever corner road. Okay. Uh-huh. And he has one in his office? Actually, now it's two. Okay. The one I use you, lay down. I mean, he's added one that you can sit up there. I prefer to line up. It's in good hours meditation, you know. Okay. Just relax and have a mask over. you're in a so i get a little womb interesting wow i can read on this for myself and had no code this but even offered uh very good so yeah it's up to you if you want to go ahead and do that prior to your joll shots yeah i don't have a problem okay i don't think it will harm us in any way or form uh so yep that's that's entirely up to you and keep me in the loop okay absolutely all right you have a good one thank you likewise yes yes will you be comfortable on your own okay okay very good i'm going to leave the door right open i need to wait for anything no just make your way out to the checkout yes please they should have everything for you at the checkout that would be just a follow-up okay you're great likewise thank you have a good one okay hello hello hi hi how are you did i leave you waiting too long a little bit i apologize let's get you started",fu,"- CPT Code: 20610

He reports a history of right knee problems for ""a few decades"" with progressive decline in function. Six years ago, he was nearly scheduled for knee replacement surgery but was advised by his physical therapist that he could potentially delay surgery with appropriate management. Patient reports that his right knee pain is currently mild (2.5/10) at rest with no pain while sitting. Pain increases with certain activities, particularly when ""coming down the wrong way"" and can reach 4-5/10 at which point he backs off activity. He notes limitations in his ability to bike as he used to, though he maintains an exercise regimen including riding a stationary bike 3 times weekly for 20 minutes. He practices two different schools of Tai Chi and performs strengthening and stretching exercises.Patient also reports bilateral shoulder pain described as ""creepy shoulders"" for approximately 7 years. He was previously evaluated by an orthopedist in Maryland who reviewed x-rays of his knees and shoulders and concluded he was ""a great candidate for surgery in all joints"" but he has been managing conservatively.Of note, in 2020, the patient experienced an episode of migratory joint pain that began with tightness in his right groin, then moved to his hip, and subsequently affected both shoulders. The shoulder pain was severe, making it difficult to put on shirts or lie down in bed, described as feeling ""like someone was sticking needles in my shoulders."" This occurred during early COVID pandemic, and he managed with self-directed physical therapy. By the time he was able to see a physician, symptoms had resolved, and blood work showed no inflammatory markers. This constellation of symptoms has not recurred.Patient had arthroscopic surgery on his left knee ""a long time ago"" which he states ""put me off surgery forever if I can avoid it."" He reports an episode approximately 10 years ago (2015) when his left knee locked after sitting cross-legged to meditate, and he was unable to unlock it for about 5 days. Records indicate ""a large lateral meniscus tear with a displaced fragment and medial meniscus"" at that time, but he declined surgery.Previous imaging from 2020 in Houston reportedly showed osteoarthritis of the right knee. Patient is currently working with a physical therapist at Atlantic Physical Therapy.","Administered corticosteroid injection to right knee today.

We have x-ray of the shoulder which it was which came back as this bilateral shoulders came back as normal study so no abnormality detected from a skeletal skeleton viewpoint of course it doesn't reflect it doesn't comment on the soft tissues and then we have bilateral knees and it says dry compartmental always present in the right knee which is more marked in the compartment small joint effusion is present left knee is read as minimal osteoarthritis with small joint and small joint effusion cannot be excluded is the small amount of fluid excuse me yeah it's funny I'm sitting by myself and I don't want I'm with a patient and I'm on poor performance well I do something Okay, so fill me in. Tell me how are things today. I know we were, I'm going back to my notes as you were walking in. I was reviewing where we left off last, six, five, twenty five, and there was an evaluation and management of right knee pain and bilateral shoulder pain, and it looks like the shoulders were red as normal and he was nearly scheduled for knee replacement surgery. was advised by his physical therapist that he could potentially delay surgery with appropriate management and that's how we met right so right knee is currently mild 2.2 and a half out of 10 at rest with no pain while sitting and he practices Tai Chi and strengthening exercises correct okay is it similar okay his imaging in Houston reportedly showed osteoarthrenness of the right knee currently working with a physical therapist Atlantic physical therapy sticking needles in my shoulder is how he described it difficult to put on shirts and lie down on bed it offered during early COVID pandemic self-directed physical therapy until you know until now is sort of getting some professional help for this uh so we ordered the needs in this blood work we saw physical therapy i said we should continue uh over-the-counter medication was was fine is that is that all that you've required so far or yeah okay and i said discuss the option of low-nosed pain medication and bedtime with pain increases noting potential side effects of sleepiness i'm maybe referring to what is called geloxetine dose and then we have interested in gel shots to bilateral needs both of a corticosteroid as a patient pain is not severe and follow up in four weeks so based on the on the x-rays that we are looking at two things the first is the right knee definitely needs a photo bone injection and once we do the cortisone injection will present the approval for the gel shots. The approval for the gel shots needs a prior forezone injection and I'll tell you why. Because the way the insurances work they go by step edit, meaning what if you try it feels? All right, and the jill shots only get a proof if you try this drug before the injection. To me, trying and failing is not as important and getting it done and climbing for it. Meaning you sort of set the knee up for success when you do a joe shot. The joe shot should follow soon enough. I mean, I shouldn't wait like six months for the joe shot to happen and do a form of injection today. Okay? Um, yes, people use a code and injection in the office. We do not require any prior approval by the requirements as you do the codecum injection. Uh, post injection is such as a very simple and ice a side of injection five minutes, which I'm sitting there. Okay. You know, whatever you the player. You can all... definitely you do it at tai chi because knowing what tai chi is or the other chi gun yeah it's q i that's the chi gong gong g gong gong okay okay there's a lot of gongcha in my area yeah yeah yeah it's all it's you know the big thing yeah gongcha is a drink that they drink is that bubble tea oh yeah yeah okay so um only because it's so low impact and it's nothing that would harm you're so but basically if you were scheduled to do something like this today I don't have any limitations to that but typically I let my patients take it easy for the day they get the injections meaning let's not be cooking like a three-hour meal or a few gallons of milk and up and down steps into the grocery so you know it's just not a day for bed rest but definitely to take it easy a little bit no bad met no my brain got it yeah say that again No badminton with my grandmother. Madminton, yeah. Badminton is, I would take it easy for today. Yeah, I don't know what the weather looks like. It's supposed to rain call. Really? And it hasn't started yet. Okay. You know, that's the way the forecast shows like we'll never see this Sunday again. I mean, we're going to be rain, rain, and the rain doesn't come, and the sun comes out and stuff. I know, it's tricky. Only because, you know, this is a track of part. So for most surgeons, we would get very happy about it to do surgery into the right knee for sure. It is, it is, it is... It's a tri-compartmental or it means that the knee has got four compartments of which three compartments have definitely involved. And the fourth compartment is a poplito pasta, it's the most compartment that typically does not get involved. So everything that can be involved is involved. And so when you say it's involved. It is showing signs of pathology. It's showing signs of arthritis, present, moderate to severe, cortisone injection. To be quite honest, in the world where gel shots may not get approved, cortis would be enough also. I only push for the gel shots because if the choice is one to cover it. is by far the best standard of care can offer you. But we definitely don't fall short if we were to leave it at a horizontal projection also. So I know you don't have a crystal ball. Right, right. But if you were to imagine you had a little bit of one, how does this play out over the years? Yeah, so that's the reason why I sort of say, let's do aggressive management today because we want to change the poor facilities. Okay. today we did it. rest and say, you'll just go home, do our exercise and take time and all that is needed. We do not really change the course of disease. Okay. So if you change the course of the disease, you have to have active management. And this is how far I go with active management. You know, first you no harm and then it takes only what's broken. And that's maybe where it is. Okay. So I'm going to stay away from all medication if I have to. That's true, yeah. Yeah, and I'm a stay away from all medication if I possibly can, so I will trust your professional judgment if you feel cortisone is, it's not something I would say yes to easily, but if you feel that's the best course at this point, I'm willing to give it a try. Perfect. I think today is a good day we should go ahead and do it. Excuse me, the other piece was Shoulder support which we have not discussed yet. They have been symptomatic. They have been read as normal. Nothing that we've not seen before. In a situation like this, I choose one or the other that is right or the left and get an MRI and then up the shoulder. Okay. Only with the intention of documenting what we, what we've seen clinically. It only helps us to get things approved moving forward. Thank you. I don't know if that is MRI, I think that. It says right D. Oh, and also say the shoulder. Yeah. August 30, 2018. Yeah. Is that an MRI or an extra? Well, that's what I don't know. Okay, what should it say in here? Radiology. It's a D MRI and the shoulder MRI. Okay, fantastic. Very good, that's exactly what I was looking here. So that might. Yes, I'm going to call this place. This is it. This is it. Maryland okay same time don't right okay so it should be open now yeah let's be off on the table let's see how we've been 2018 today's 2025 so seven years seven years okay we're right back yep Oh, I also need to put in a motor for Deppo. What, 10 to you see in the day? 10 to 15. It's a lot, but not, I don't know, too much. No, it's, in my opinion, it's not too much, yet it fills up my day. Yeah, I'm not sure. I'm here until 6, so, yeah. Oh. Oh. I am keeping an arbitrarily a follow-up visit for four weeks from today, just with the intention that we, if you get the Georgia as approved, we should be able to see other then okay uh so that's something else good to out there yes exactly and uh so today's visit we're doing depplement roll the large joint and uh and uh And confirm with me, if we're gonna do both these while we do, if the Jolshaws do get approved? Well, my left me doesn't. Bother you? Yeah, it doesn't. It seems fine. However, it is showing mild cases of mild signs. of arthritis compared to the other knee it's definitely it the process is there in my opinion i think if you were to do shots we should do it both so we don't see any problems we don't have to go forward for this guy at all for that knee and only the gel shots which have no real side effects so the right knees okay so i'll put in a request for both and be right with you now Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I don't know. I'm going to be. I don't know. We're going to be. We're going to be. We're going to be. We're going to be able to be. You know? It was a . I'm a . Okay, so they're working on this. This is Deppermedro. Okay. Okay, so it's an introtic in a steroid preparation. Everybody would do the same, ortho, room, sports medicine. So it's just going to be disqualifying from the Olympics. Yeah, no way. Yeah, I have, you know, it's really interesting. I have yet to read on it in depth, because of course I know this part of the sphere well, But I don't know how they, they graduate, use a steroid in an athlete. And if your knees hurting, you will get a steroid injection. It's like disqualify you, but you're only treating her injury. Yeah. So, I can't get it. Or you're taking it to boost your energy level? Yeah. You know what it is? Okay. Well, in muscle mass, you know, that in the baseball steroid era, that was a big thing. But which should... Is it because my patient getting steroids out to lose muscle mass, gain body fat, don't look good. Definitely don't look like an athlete if they're on it as well. Yeah, that's not my area of expertise. But we lived in the Bay Area back in the day when the steroid football was heating up in very bonds. And then he considered the greatest player of that era was accused of taking steroids. So, although he... never tested positive for them. And you could see, you know, if you just put pictures of them side by side how his body mass bulked up. But what people say is the things he could do, you know, his eye, his reflex, steroids don't affect that. But he's the all-time leader in home runs and other things. probably never get elected to the baseball Hall of Fame because even though he was, again, never tested positive and he actually was put on trial and acquitted, but. No, does it buy them? There you go. Okay. I'm guessing that we don't do that through my pants. No. But you're wearing the right clothing. So let me call it. Just bring it forward a little bit to the break of the bed, that's good enough for me. Okay. Okay, and... Okay, here we are. How do I get to say ouch? It's up to you. Well, I don't think that's what we will encounter, but yeah, it's an experience. If I'm going to say, ouch, I can. Of course, freedom of speech. Okay. Well, let's hang on to it as long as we can. So this is the medial joint space, that's really the biggest brunt of austral resistance here. Okay. So this is the lateral joint space. Mm-hmm. So this is the lateral joint space. So medium and lateral. Okay. the protection of tomorrow or which I'm good. the Gap, which we typically don't access. Unless with the swelling or is a fluid there. It's simple for me, but I'm trying to look for it is any fluid in this need today because it didn't mention a join the fusion on the X-ray. I don't feel I need here. Everything needs to be charged. Yeah, everyone is charged for some. Oh, there is... Sorry about that. So the purpose of getting an ultrasound. So the purpose of getting an ultrasound the room is to get a bedside assessment of what we're up against. You know, it's not people who are going to do an extra an MRI. The idea of a bedside assessment is to make sure we're not dealing with any acute swelling. Not to make compromise needs need an ultrasound regarding the injection for the most part. Well, I didn't even more than capable of him. I'm saying to trust that completely. Thank you. I appreciate that. So why do you see? No, it's not with me. You said you play, uh, did you play? maybe you could just exercise as much exercise I exercise I play games like cribbage oh yeah okay table and our grand children are here 13 brain twins so I play badminton oh yeah that's our granddaughter and croquet so who's a badminton Well, when I was younger, I played a lot of them. We have a set that hasn't met that even played them and they're volleyball. Okay, yeah. Our granddaughter and grandson hit the volleyball back and forth with each other. Mm-hmm. Our granddaughter and I have that birdie around. Yeah. I think it happens in Badminton and volleyball is sort of versatile sports, so you can sort of set them up wherever. Absolutely. Well, in Croquet too. Prok? How do you play Koke? In croquet, you have two sticks at either end of the course and two wickets in front and then two on the sides, one of the middle two on the side. So you start on one end and you have a mallet and a ball and you hit the ball through the first two wickets, then go out. to make it stand there. the side to the middle to the side uh-huh to the two wickets in the stick on the other and then come back through on the other side interesting you play with uh you know as many people want to play wow i should look up a video to see how it's it's fun and you know formally the people who play it formally you know you have a perfectly manicured croaked blonde and all this stuff we really kind of part of the joy and challenge is having a bumpy yard and being behind the tree and on the hill. So you can put up a croquet set anywhere you want. I see. I see. Yeah. But it's, you know, unless you're the mall or the mallet head, it's a low impact sport. It's a little. Very good. Yes, I see what you see. And you have everyone outdoors, you know, in the backyard and moving around a little. Yes. Yes, no room for boredom, I like that. Yeah, I've played ProK since I was a little boy and had them too. They just carry on the tradition. That's real good. Yeah. It does sound like an interesting game. It sort of is an offshoot of what we already know is that about hockey versus. Would you say it's like a hockey? Well, it's... Less players though. You... It's one at a time. time each person has their own ball and their own mallet. I see. So it's more like golf that way. Okay, I see what you're saying. So instead of 18 holes, you've got two, four, and the nine wickets. Uh-huh. So what are you up against time? No, no. You play against each other. So, you know, obviously you go one at a time. We do things like, okay, from the youngest goes first, the oldest goes last, or you can have everyone line up and hit their balls toward the post. and the closest goes first and then you just play and you know the idea is you if you want to win if you care about that you want to be the first one to complete the course i see and we used to play the way i grew up was the first one who completed the course and hit the post got to be poisoned and that meant if that person's ball hit anyone else's ball, they were automatically out. So the game would end with everyone eliminated but won. And then about a year ago, we were playing in our daughter for the first time in their life won. And she said, this is the first time I've ever gotten to complete the course. And I thought, well, that's not right. So I outlawed poison. I said, we're not going to play that anymore when the first person finishes that person's done and everyone else can keep on playing if they don't want to they don't have to but everyone else can keep on playing until they're done okay so everyone gets the experience of doing the whole course yes yes and I think that would keep all the arguments of the field right yeah it annoyed our son who's often winning and he did like that I made a unilateral rule that way, but you'll get used to it. I'll be right back, okay? I'll be here. Okay. I'm just getting myself in a little bit. Yeah, I have to throw them away, so I have none in the back now. Thank you. Surprise. It's like, you know, keeping track of your groceries, making sure something is on the shore. Yeah, yeah, it's always good to have that backup. I'm guessing for you, even more important. So you can run around the corner and get some of that backup. Not this one, yeah. Close way. So the way we do this is I take a picture, which I just did. Clean it, love it with the loving thread, and go in with the nails. Go ahead. Pushing the medicine. Mm-hmm. I don't need to say how she is. Okay, we're almost done, bringing myself out. Perfect. I see the side of injection, five minutes two times today, they're after you're going to have got a heat or whatever you prefer. Okay. Okay. Five minutes, two times today. Correct. Yep. And I never get to go play soccer or over. Even bad minutes. So I'll have to be a couch potato. Our grand twins and I are about not even a third of the way in of a series based on a series of books that I read first to our daughter when she was a little. Really? Which one is that? Well, it's, the series is called His Dark Materials. Okay. The three books, and that's from a quote from Milton. The three books are called The Golden Compass, the Amber Spy Glass, and the Golden Compass, Subtle Knife, Amber Spy Glass. The protagonist of the Golden Compass is a young girl, young woman right on the cusp of puberty. And she's an amazing character. character. The book plays around with multiple universes and the subtle knife in the second book is an implement that can actually open a scene that allows the person who cuts it to move from one universe to another or one world to another. So the other protagonist is a young boy about the same age and they both live in Oxford but in different worlds. But they end up coming to together in the second book and you know it's it's a fantasy there are armored bears in the the Oxford that the girl lives in Lyra is her name everyone has a demon that is an external manifestation of their soul until puberty the demon can be any shape it wants any time and if puberty is it settles and becomes the shape for the rest of your life. Wow. In the Oxford, the boy is from, they don't have demons outside visible like that. So the question is where is their soul? You know, it's a rousing adventure story, but with some deep, deep theology, you know, the, you know, the best, the sort of bad guys are called the magisterium and it's basically a religious hierarchy that tries to dictate everything to everyone and says this is allowed that's not allowed and where do you find this in Netflix yeah well the the series is on max max which used to be B.M. Okay, okay, got it. But the books too, I don't know. I don't know how old. You have kids? Yes, I do. So middle school, high schoolers. Middle school? Yes, yes. This is good food for power. The golden compass. Sure. The first one. Yeah. Our grandson was 13 now. He said halfway through the third book. Fantastic. I'll definitely get a hold of Yeah, they're great. Yeah. Actually, the authors... going on to write while we're waiting for the third and the second trilogy. The first one was a prequel, and the second was the sequel to the three that were first published. And I've been waiting for about three years for the third one. Really? It keeps saying it's just about done. So it is the process. Okay, very good. I thought the other things of the past, but now they're still very much active, working on that. So Charles, what I have here for you is, this is the surface of your knee, all right, hardly any joint space. So this is definitely well deserved. And I have already put in order for orthodox, for me. Orthovesque is a joll shot that I know the office has procured and we like to use them as first time. However, if insurance does not approve it, we'll just choose whatever is on their formula. So that is something that will work its way and you will get letters. as correspondents explaining where we are with the approval process. I'm saving this to your chart, which I just did. No medications from me. A follow-up in four weeks. We reviewed the x-rays and the blood work. I have yet to see that MRI that comes through. The staff is working on it. I know it may take anywhere between 15 minutes to two hours, depending on when it does pop up. But we will stay in touch with the approval for the gel shots because that's the next thing on my list of things to do. All right. And you can always, you know, feel free to call the office and get an update if there are any questions. I have one other question. Do you have any experience with and or opinion of hyperbaric oxygen chambers? For osteoarthritis? For just helping regenerate in the body. Okay. So I have heard, I've never, I've never used one or prescribed one, but I have read on hyperbaric oxygen chambers for wound management. and that's how far I read it okay well I've actually used okay and when I told my doctor that I was thinking about gel shots he said well I would suggest before you get the gel shots have a couple of sessions in the oxygen chamber and after the gel shot have a couple because that will help that be more effective I never heard that before as pre, a prelude and sort of, you know, no. Other than a horizontal injection, which we just did, and I wouldn't even know where to find it. Well, I'm going to be a guinea pig. You prefer to, okay. And give that a try. Okay. Just because, as I say, I've done the hyperbaric oxygen chain. And it's just in terms of the way I've, afterwards. It was good. And where did you find it? Well, my primary theater is the principal integrated health. Uh-huh. Over on whatever corner road. Okay. Uh-huh. And he has one in his office? Actually, now it's two. Okay. The one I use you, lay down. I mean, he's added one that you can sit up there. I prefer to line up. It's in good hours meditation, you know. Okay. Just relax and have a mask over. you're in a so i get a little womb interesting wow i can read on this for myself and had no code this but even offered uh very good so yeah it's up to you if you want to go ahead and do that prior to your joll shots yeah i don't have a problem okay i don't think it will harm us in any way or form uh so yep that's that's entirely up to you and keep me in the loop okay absolutely all right you have a good one thank you likewise yes yes will you be comfortable on your own okay okay very good i'm going to leave the door right open i need to wait for anything no just make your way out to the checkout yes please they should have everything for you at the checkout that would be just a follow-up okay you're great likewise thank you have a good one okay hello hello hi hi how are you did i leave you waiting too long a little bit i apologize let's get you started"", 'diarized_transcript_csv_url': ''}"

CHIEF COMPLAINT:
Evaluation and management of preauricular swelling, worsening skin lesions on legs, and follow-up on dental imaging findings

INTERVAL HISTORY:
Patient presents for follow-up of preauricular sinus on the left side that has been present for approximately 6 months and is now visible, whereas it was not visible before. Patient recently underwent dental imaging (360 degree CT scan) on 7-8-2025 with Dr. Weddle, a TMJ/TMD specialist. The imaging showed hypertrophy of the tonsils, enlarged adenoids, narrow airway, and arthritis of the temporomandibular joints and cervical spine. Patient reports longstanding TMJ but notes recent bite change that prompted evaluation. Patient has had migraines since puberty, currently managed with Qulipta and Ubrelvy which work approximately 80% of the time. Patient reports some hearing loss but has not been formally evaluated. Patient also presents with worsening skin lesions on both legs and back of knees that started small and have gotten progressively larger over the past several months. Patient has been applying tacrolimus and clobetasol without improvement. Patient denies these lesions are eczema, stating she has eczema elsewhere but this appears different. Patient wore pulse oximetry devices overnight as part of dental evaluation to assess oxygen saturation patterns. Patient currently takes synthetic thyroid medication 75 mcg once daily, waiting 30 minutes before eating. Patient has been taking vitamin D and calcium for osteopenia and reduced vitamin B to once weekly dosing.

And so we had said to keep an eye on it. Now, Rita also told me you had, if you had a CAT scan or x-rays of your jaw, didn't show anything from the dentist? It was really highly technical, so I sent the report to Rita so that she can take a look at it. Yeah, I don't think that she got it yet, but I guess we could look at it. Maybe she didn't have a chance to take a look at it. Because, I mean, I just sent it to her. Okay, yeah. Let me see. Yeah. Rita, do you mind? He said he sent you the reports. Can you scan it? Okay, let me know. Okay. And then did he say anything about, did it show anything on that side? Not that I know of. She didn't mention anything about it because my concern going to her was on this side. My TMJ is like really bad. Okay. And my bite changed. Yeah. So she did, um, not a sleep study, but, uh, I wore, um, pulse oxymeters okay so kind of like the post up for the night to see if you these sats to see if you're having any kind of if I was like having problems sleeping and and stopping breathing and the results are in that report as well okay so she wants me to go see a sleep specialist okay so she already reviewed it with you she did but this is your dentist yeah okay her name is Dr. Weddle She is W-E-D-D-L-E. Okay. She's a specialist in TMJ and TMD. Yeah. Okay. Her name is Dr. Weddell. She is W-E-D-D-D-L-E. Okay. She's a specialist in TMJ and TMD. Okay. I didn't expect that. I was just seeing her because she's someone who masks. Because a lot of dentists don't mask anymore, which I think is insane. Oh, okay. I know. So she turns out to be this specialist. Yeah, that's good. You know, 360. It's basically like a CT scan. Yeah, I think they do it like for the kids, like for braces to see to. Okay. Yeah, had it done for an endo, a retreatment of... my crowns oh i see okay yeah because they have to see like the bones the jaw yeah so i've had it done before but i didn't have it of the jaw on the throat and she said that my airway is like super narrow so she was concerned and she said you know look at your posture and my posture is such that like my head you go inward yeah she said that there's problems with that so um that's why i said i wanted to send it to you, but I didn't have your direct email, so I had to wait until today. Okay, so we'll look at it, and then I kids, I mean but I guess if she did send it right um yeah uh when they do it they do both sides yes it's a whole thing yeah so yeah so did you still were you able to yeah i download it first but so it's okay okay so you don't like that kind of okay so look okay but you can absolutely request the original files from her. I will let her know that you're going to do that. Okay, so let me see her. that let me walk real quick because I mean the so yeah so the posture I mean she did kind of because you see how yeah puts you in terms like you're not middle like that should be like halfway the other thing is I don't want to forget this that I've got this really bad patiquiate on my legs that's getting worse and on the back of my knees okay that's that's not really the tiki, though. Oh, okay. Yeah, I mean, that looks like you have like an eczema. It is not eczema. It is not an eczema? Okay. I have eczema. This is not an excema. So then maybe we got to send you to a dermatologist and they could do a biopsy to see exactly because off the top. Yeah. So it doesn't look like, because fatigue will be like different. You know, so this is like a rash because it's more, I see like it's like discovered. You went to a dermatologist? No, I stopped doing my dermatologist. I need a new dermatologist that's going to mask up because my I refused. Because I would recommend I would do a topical steroid cream. You're not allergic to that one, are you? No. No. I can't take like a cream. Yeah. You can't not a problem. Okay, because if not, then the other one that may help is they have either the seravi, the seravi, they have the healing ointment. I could write a serrivy, the healing ointment I will put it Sarah be the healing ointment I will put there and then I will do a steroid and then you could take, I would take a picture because if it goes away, so when you go see the dermatologist. It has not all gone away. Yeah, I've been using my eczema stuff on this, and I know it's not eczema, because... Okay, what eczema stuff are you using? I use tachrolimus or the other one is... I have tachrolymus here, yeah. Oh, so you do use Grobeta-sol? Yeah. Okay, that is kind of a steroid type. It is, yeah. So that doesn't work? No, nothing has changed this. In fact, it's gotten worse. So I really don't think this is a rash. You don't think it's a rash? No. I have all kinds of things with my skin. Yeah. And I've had this on my arm, which is similar to this, for years. And nothing is changed. Okay. But but these guys it started small and it's gotten larger on both legs so you may need a biopsy then like do you see have they ever done a biopsy because at this point if you have used the topical for the cobitisol on there and it didn't go away then I would recommend yeah we'll need to do a biopsy to know for sure exactly and it doesn't look because patica it will be different you know and you wouldn't let me see your plate with count i know you saw the oncologists i can't get into the the plate are good, 260, so they would not, you know, I wouldn't, just, you know, that doesn't look like particular to me, because it's more like, patiquet will be more like blood-like. Yours is kind of spread out, it'll be smaller. That's why I was thinking that's what it was in back of my knees, because it kind of looks like that in back of my knees. Yeah, no, there is something else, but um i would yeah so i'll that one, we use over here Dr. Rothsch, I can't tell you if they do mask up or not but I believe if you ask them I think they would do you see they're right here 603 cranberry rule so be so per rash evaluate and treat I mean they're pretty good so 603 and she'll write it up cranberry road so that would be yeah that would be the recommendation because it it it doesn't it to me, yeah, it looks like, I mean, it's hyper pigment. because it's not it's not like a reddish it's almost like a brownish but the one here because normally for eczema it's normally in the areas like you see like in the back of the knee yeah I've never had it so but yeah so that's like on my arms and on my neck but I don't have on my neck in years yeah so the the recommended it will be yeah either would say the Derm because they could do a biopsy, because you said you've had this for how long? number of months so it's steadily gotten worse in the last couple of months it's gotten worse okay okay yeah so let's do that we'll do the dermatologist and let's see with this so so with your let me see let me put it so this was on June 17 right that you saw I just saw her to get the report but um like she did this this week okay oh yeah so it looks like July ate. Yeah. I mean, I wore the things last month. Okay, because the part of the dental part, you know, that's she'll, that's with her, right, for the bias. But she says, okay, so she said your airway is symmetrical. She said you do have hypertrophy of the tonsils. I mean, they're a little bit swollen. They're enlarged. So, and the adenoids are inwards. So, um... but she was saying the sinuses are okay. So with the tonsils and adenoids, that's behind, that's like an airnosed and throat, meaning that could be what's making you maybe not sweep or snore. For that, normally some people need to have that removed if it becomes a problem. That's part of like, you know, if it does show that you have sweep apnea and that will be an air nose and throat specialist have you seen one of those I have but only for like allergies and my sinus, well, I thought I had sinus problems and it turned out to be migraines. Yeah, because I was going to say the sinus here were okay. I've had my sinuses looked at and they're fine. But, you know, I have this. So she was trying to put together the big picture and she said, well, you've got migraines. And I said, well, I've had migraines since I went through puberty. But now they're changing, right? like in terms of like you started with just a headache but it's not right it's no i mean i've had migraines for i've been living with them for a long time and And the eulipta and the uberlvie generally work, you know, at least 80% of the time. And then she said, yeah, she said you have arthritis of the cervical spine. And I guess you also say that for you, I mean, did she send you to be evaluated by the dentist? She is the dentist. Oh, she is. Okay. Because she said there was a little bit of cavities i guess or oh the report was done by radiologists oh so then she goes all right right um I don't have cavities okay yeah because on here like she was saying recommend dental carries cannot be ruled out but I guess maybe it was the implant my whole dental situation is really good it's just that they didn't weren't able to see so yeah so they were saying that you had the hypertrophy of the tonsils the structure I way that, you know, makes the minimal position of the tongue, I think it's probably making your airway. be a little bit not compromised, right, because you're breathing, but, you know, they are saying however the rate of concerns exist, possibly underlying allergic should be considered, and auto-warangolaryngology evaluation can be considered which is the ear, nose, and throat to look. Normally they use that little varyngoscope and they go through the nose and they see the airway and then they say arthritis of the temperament they're joints and that's what she's working on that's this whole deal yeah sometimes they give you like some exercises right and don't chew like take big bites yeah i've had tm j for a really long time but my bite changed and that was what kind of prompted all this okay so the sleep study i don't have so is she just a referral to doctor knee for sleep study and hold off on tmj a bit after sleep study yeah i haven't seen dr knee i'm a little questioning about that because darkening is listed as a pediatrician. I don't seen Dr. Knee. I'm a little questioning about Dr. Ney, because Darkneed is listed as a pediatrician. Why don't... knee pediatrician yeah he's at st. Peters let me see I don't know is that a sleep specialist he's supposed to be I think she said people to him before he's seen Eastern Avenue I'm not sure but I know he's associated with st peters um dr samuel knee sweep study I mean, it's in here, it's fit Samuel Ney. It says he's the Children's Hospital at St. Peter's. Yeah, that's why I was questioning. I'm like, well, my insurance is going to say pediatrician, and that's not going to make any sense to them. Yeah, I guess I would just call them. I mean, it does say, it does look like he's, so I don't know him. Some people do adult, and I don't really know him. Some people do adult and pediatrics. I mean, so it does look, maybe, you know, he can have a specialty in both. He may be able to see both. I mean, but it does say pediatrics there. Yeah. But I think she would know that you wouldn't be considered, but they would have there, St. Peter's also has an adult, so maybe in the center where he's at, they have a adult, because they have a sleep center. But I wonder if, do you need to go see the um or the the ear nose and throat because the ear nose and throat they also order sleep studies if you need it so um i guess i would call her back because i mean she's you know really been thorough and i would just question like meaning you know she might know i don't know that specialist dr knee so it might or just call the office and ask them because it might be that he does both. Okay. And then, you know, know I don't know that specialist doctor knee so it might or just call the office and ask them because it might be that he does both okay and then you know you know, then you would be okay. Yeah. So, I mean, I think that's a good idea to rule out. But then part of it could be because of the tonsill, like the anatomy, like we said. And then the other thing, too, we may need to do some, I guess, exercises or therapy in order to see maybe like the posture and the strengthening of the cervical spine to help a little bit. I mean, that's not going to be, you know, that's going to be over time. but that can also help. Manessi can work with me on that if you give me a prescription for it. Yes, because she is not just an oncological lymphedema specialist. She does physical therapy. Yeah, she is all over physical therapy, but she also does spine stuff. Did we, yeah, so let me see. So where are primaries I'll do. I'll just put physical therapy, right? Because she's part of that. and because it does show a little bit like arthritis um okay so let's put um this will be physical therapy and then we'll put in here cervical yeah i do exercise some exercises that she gave me previously for that oh okay for things but you know it would be good to have a physical therapy yeah no that would be good and she could give you more yeah and it would be good too I guess we could give you if you want after she scans so we could give you this as a copy so she can have it too yes well I can email her okay yeah I can email her that yeah yeah I'll do that now yeah because that will be arthritis in the neck. Okay, so we'll put them. And so we'll put them and So per evaluate and treat Okay, all right, she'll print it out. Okay, so we'll print it out. Okay, so we'll do it away. So let's take it away so we'll do that and And then from your blood work, I know that you did a CBC, a CMP, with the oncologists, but from January, then, have you checked your cholesterol? No, and we also need to check my thyroid. Okay. So did you eat today or no? Today would be, I have, yeah, I had a banana, like two hours ago. Two hours ago, I mean, if it's just, I guess. I mean, it would be better if it was just fast. Fasting, that could influence slightly because remember your cholesterol was a little high last time. So I would like it to be fasting, fasting, meaning nothing past midnight the night before and just have water the day of. So I could have, either you could come back another time or are you seeing the oncologist and we'll pass it by there? Not many times soon no are you able to pass by like like monday tuesday uh not monday i can tell you that all i guess yeah next week wednesday thursday let me see my calendar uh i could uh when do i have it tuesday first thing in the morning like 8 a.m tuesday yeah i mean she's usually here in the way, like 8 a.m. Tuesday? Yeah, I mean she's usually here 8.10. You could come 8 a.m. but the lab before wives usually she's here 810 so that because you know and we've been doing a little bit with the lifestyle i mean i know your diet was pretty good but we want to trying to cut down a little bit um and then just more protein and the vegetables because it was slightly it's been high for a really long time um yeah it was 237 and the lL 144 the good thing is your sugar was good and there was no pre-diabetes. Okay. So I can come at 8.15. Would you be able to schedule it or? Tuesday, yeah. I'll tell the front, but technically normally you don't need to schedule. But, you know, we just let him know because I wrote it for today. So they'll pass it over. They put it over. Okay. For the Tuesday. Okay, so we'll do that. So we'll do the cholesterol plus the... The thyroid and I'll check, I don't think we'll checked your vitamin D or because it was a little high but then you cut it down a little bit right B the the D no B you want to do the B no vitamin D I need to take D in calcium to prevent osteoporosis yeah because you had osteopinia but from from a little bit was like in the 69 so we got to keep a night that doesn't get too high well the problem that you were interested in was B the B at January 10, right? Yeah. Yeah. So now I'm only taking B once a week. Okay. All right. So we'll check both because it's been since January. So it's been like over six months. I'm going to be taking high levels of vitamin D. Which is good, but we'll make sure that doesn't go over 100. Okay. That doesn't go too high. Okay, let me change that because we're touching your legs. and yeah because let me just look then again so in terms of here so the scans didn't really show anything right because it you know it would so it sounds you mean in terms of this thing yeah yeah so the swelling is just so like we had said before so it looks like it's kind of benign but if we want to kind of like have it more evaluated it would be the ear nose and throat that's just like a yeah because sometimes it could get like a sinus drainage there. Sometimes it could get a little pus. And you need to, it's like a pre-oricular tip. That was genetic. Someone in your family had that. Like either your mom, dad, usually like someone else has it. So it could get, sometimes it could get, like, infected. So usually you have to do like warm compresses. It is associated, but usually with hearing loss. How's your hearing then? I have a little hearing loss. I haven't been evaluated. Okay. So, that's just because like in PDA When we see a baby that has that, they do, I mean, normally they have the initial hearing loss anyway in the hospital, but usually they fall up, like, within three, six months for a repeat just to make sure. But usually it's benign, that little prerequisite of pay. But that must have been genetic. So that's not like something bad, but if you do again, like we could send you the ear nose and throat to make sure they do they have the audiologist usually within the group to do the hearing. And you may need them anyway eventually, especially because of the tonsils. And if we do have the sleep apnea, sometimes the treatment could be like either a mouth guard to kind of lower. Yeah, I wear a mouth guard already, but it's not for that. Okay, because it's just for the teeth, right? Okay, and she might have to change eventually because of the TMJ, right? Yeah, so I know it's kind of like, It's complex. It's not easy. So the... okay and she might have to change eventually because of the TMJ right yeah so I know it's kind of like it's complex it's not easy um so the dermatologist for sure because if you already been using that the high steroid cream and it's not helping then I can't really like tell you what it would be without most likely you know because usually they they probably would want to give you a steroid initially anyway too so you have to tell them that you've been on that and that they might need the biopsy and then since we are giving you then the um refer to dermatologist do you want us to do the ear nose and throat. We use here the E&T Associates of New Jersey they're over here on Cranberry Road and part of it they have like everything I mean they have the audiologist ear nose and throat and actually they do have an allergist Dr. Axelrod like within you know it's different different physicians but within the group they have the different specialties yeah i have to see if they're in my network okay so i'll give you the the uh referral uh yeah the the the names and the address uh with the referral then we'll check okay deep breath went out good breath right out good deep breath right out good deep breath right out and last one right out and you know i know you're using these but i was looking and they say i don't know if this is also making you kind of like leaning more forward with your neck I've had I know you're using these, but I was looking and I say, I don't know if this is also making you kind of like lean more forward with your neck? Pratt posture for a while. Okay. It's really, you know, carrying around 20 pounds of the extra weight. Yeah, so you don't take, like, having... Oh, no, this is new. This is new. Okay, so it's natural. Okay, yeah, because I'm going to say if you put that over, like, sometimes it would it weigh more? Okay. It's just a fan. I wear it temporarily. Okay, yeah, because like, do you see what I'm trying to say? Because if you put it on, I don't know if it will make you more. No, it's really, it's, it's boobs. It's having very heavy and lymphedina so well. Well, yeah,, it's boobs. It's having very heavy and lymphedina so well. Well, yeah, because of the web. side right yeah okay normal good and you go into the bathroom okay yeah okay and the legs now look good okay perfect so do you need a refill on the centroid um no that's automatic i think i've got some refills on there. You're doing the 75 once a day and you're waiting. waiting half an hour to eat. Yeah, yeah. I mean, I start my day really early at like 4.30. I don't eat until like 7. Okay, okay. So you're doing good. And yeah, so then your blood pressure is good. And your weight is staying stable. How much was it last time? It was 161.6. So it's basically the same. And then colonoscopy I think I've got another year but but I'm not sure. I see Deborah Goldstein. Goldstein, okay. We might end to get the report just to see. So we'll put in here. Doctor, okay. Goldstein, Deborah. Okay, so we'll put here. Yeah, it should be in there because it's St. Peter's. Yeah, I just added her to your provider. She wasn't in there. And I'll add this one, the doctor. wed work because um so you see w-e-d-d-l-e oh yeah so if you need a dentist she is the most thorough where is she at uh Warren oh okay okay it's a little up but you know yeah this is really this is really nice she is not kidding around no this is really good I mean I like the way and yeah thank you this is good we'll keep it on the this is like really informative like it should she took a ton of pictures i mean like she had her people do it but yeah i i had no idea what i was going into when i got there i thought i was just going to go see the dentist and no it's a good experience right oh yeah i all you want is someone who's thorough yeah you found out a lot of stuff not only when everything is kind of like does get together in terms of your TMJ and oral care because it's, you know, goes together. They should, it should be like of New Jersey so we'll put in here and then we'll do weft pre-orricular pre-orricular lesion and we'll put in it yeah so I've had it now for what like a good six months or so because you checked it the last time. Yeah, so you had, yeah. It's not like worse, right? Well, it's visible now. It wasn't visible before. Yeah, we'll do warm compresses too. And then you'll watch tons. Those will put, and we'll put also... So we evaluate and decrease hearing. You know, I don't know if it's really decreased or not. I've had hearing loss for a long time. But I would like to get it checked get it checked okay okay so let's do this then so we'll have you for Tuesday to come to do the blood work. I'll have Andrea do both for the dermatologist, for the rash, and then we'll do the ear, nose, and throat associates. And then I guess let's follow up with Dr. Wero in terms of Dr. Knee. If, you know, he does see adults too. If not, I know if you call St. Peter's, they do have an adult. It's a group. Sometimes it takes a while. We're not. We also use over here 593 Cranberry Road, but they're like the pulmonary, and they do have the Pomerary Associates of New Jersey, 593 Cranberry Road. It's not a sleep center, but they do have like sleep specialist, like a pulmonary that it does, you know, kind of specializing that. We use a sleep study, like a home sleep study. So, I mean, if those are dead ends is that different than what she had me do it's like you wear a thing a watch kind of thing on your wrist I don't know which one she had, because mine actually shows in terms of, it's not in here, mine actually, for the sleep study, it actually gives you the desaturation and gives you if you have sleep apnea or not. It doesn't look like hers did, or else she would have told you, you wouldn't need to go see a specialist. So you see what, so i'll give you the information on it because if anything we can order that home sweep study i think mine is different the one she ordered on hers here she didn't really mention that she just had referred you yeah it was just like to you know wear a wrist thing and then there was a ring and it was just basically pulse oxymeters yeah so if she didn't check the desaturation right because she says so it wasn't a sweep study, sweep study, per se. um she was just looking at your sweep's pattern um so when you order one of those where do you get it from it's a company blackstone they send it to your house oh okay and you wear it for 24 hours and then you send it back and then when you send it back they evaluate it and then they give you they give you the reading um So, yeah, so hers was looking more of oxymetry. She wasn't looking in terms of how many hours, right, like you were sleeping. So it's not exactly a sleep study. Because insurance wouldn't cover another one. So she, it wasn't. So I'll give me- Well, the insurance barely covered this, but it was, you know, it wasn't under my healthcare stuff. It was under my dental. Okay. I have to pay a huge amount of money for all of this. Oh, I understand. Okay, yeah. So I'll give you the information. If the sweep study is a dead end, we can then have you do our home sweep study. But regardless, though, let's see then the dermatologist and the ear, nose, and throat associates you. Maybe have you come back in two months, because it will give you kind of time to see if you do see the sleep study specialist and the dermatologist and the urnose and throat okay all right Okay, so very good. A lot of stuff, huh? I know.",fu,"- CPT Code: 70336

Patient recently underwent dental imaging (360 degree CT scan) on 7-8-2025 with Dr. Weddle, a TMJ/TMD specialist. The imaging showed hypertrophy of the tonsils, enlarged adenoids, narrow airway, and arthritis of the temporomandibular joints and cervical spine. Patient reports longstanding TMJ but notes recent bite change that prompted evaluation. Patient has had migraines since puberty, currently managed with Qulipta and Ubrelvy which work approximately 80% of the time. Patient reports some hearing loss but has not been formally evaluated. Patient also presents with worsening skin lesions on both legs and back of knees that started small and have gotten progressively larger over the past several months. Patient has been applying tacrolimus and clobetasol without improvement. Patient denies these lesions are eczema, stating she has eczema elsewhere but this appears different. Patient wore pulse oximetry devices overnight as part of dental evaluation to assess oxygen saturation patterns.

And so we had said to keep an eye on it. Now, Rita also told me you had, if you had a CAT scan or x-rays of your jaw, didn't show anything from the dentist? It was really highly technical, so I sent the report to Rita so that she can take a look at it. Yeah, I don't think that she got it yet, but I guess we could look at it. Maybe she didn't have a chance to take a look at it. Because, I mean, I just sent it to her. Okay, yeah. Let me see. Yeah. Rita, do you mind? He said he sent you the reports. Can you scan it? Okay, let me know. Okay. And then did he say anything about, did it show anything on that side? Not that I know of. She didn't mention anything about it because my concern going to her was on this side. My TMJ is like really bad. Okay. And my bite changed. Yeah. So she did, um, not a sleep study, but, uh, I wore, um, pulse oxymeters okay so kind of like the post up for the night to see if you these sats to see if you're having any kind of if I was like having problems sleeping and and stopping breathing and the results are in that report as well okay so she wants me to go see a sleep specialist okay so she already reviewed it with you she did but this is your dentist yeah okay her name is Dr. Weddle She is W-E-D-D-L-E. Okay. She's a specialist in TMJ and TMD. Yeah. Okay. Her name is Dr. Weddell. She is W-E-D-D-D-L-E. Okay. She's a specialist in TMJ and TMD. Okay. I didn't expect that. I was just seeing her because she's someone who masks. Because a lot of dentists don't mask anymore, which I think is insane. Oh, okay. I know. So she turns out to be this specialist. Yeah, that's good. You know, 360. It's basically like a CT scan. Yeah, I think they do it like for the kids, like for braces to see to. Okay. Yeah, had it done for an endo, a retreatment of... my crowns oh i see okay yeah because they have to see like the bones the jaw yeah so i've had it done before but i didn't have it of the jaw on the throat and she said that my airway is like super narrow so she was concerned and she said you know look at your posture and my posture is such that like my head you go inward yeah she said that there's problems with that so um that's why i said i wanted to send it to you, but I didn't have your direct email, so I had to wait until today. Okay, so we'll look at it, and then I kids, I mean but I guess if she did send it right um yeah uh when they do it they do both sides yes it's a whole thing yeah so yeah so did you still were you able to yeah i download it first but so it's okay okay so you don't like that kind of okay so look okay but you can absolutely request the original files from her. I will let her know that you're going to do that. Okay, so let me see her. that let me walk real quick because I mean the so yeah so the posture I mean she did kind of because you see how yeah puts you in terms like you're not middle like that should be like halfway the other thing is I don't want to forget this that I've got this really bad patiquiate on my legs that's getting worse and on the back of my knees okay that's that's not really the tiki, though. Oh, okay. Yeah, I mean, that looks like you have like an eczema. It is not eczema. It is not an eczema? Okay. I have eczema. This is not an excema. So then maybe we got to send you to a dermatologist and they could do a biopsy to see exactly because off the top. Yeah. So it doesn't look like, because fatigue will be like different. You know, so this is like a rash because it's more, I see like it's like discovered. You went to a dermatologist? No, I stopped doing my dermatologist. I need a new dermatologist that's going to mask up because my I refused. Because I would recommend I would do a topical steroid cream. You're not allergic to that one, are you? No. No. I can't take like a cream. Yeah. You can't not a problem. Okay, because if not, then the other one that may help is they have either the seravi, the seravi, they have the healing ointment. I could write a serrivy, the healing ointment I will put it Sarah be the healing ointment I will put there and then I will do a steroid and then you could take, I would take a picture because if it goes away, so when you go see the dermatologist. It has not all gone away. Yeah, I've been using my eczema stuff on this, and I know it's not eczema, because... Okay, what eczema stuff are you using? I use tachrolimus or the other one is... I have tachrolymus here, yeah. Oh, so you do use Grobeta-sol? Yeah. Okay, that is kind of a steroid type. It is, yeah. So that doesn't work? No, nothing has changed this. In fact, it's gotten worse. So I really don't think this is a rash. You don't think it's a rash? No. I have all kinds of things with my skin. Yeah. And I've had this on my arm, which is similar to this, for years. And nothing is changed. Okay. But but these guys it started small and it's gotten larger on both legs so you may need a biopsy then like do you see have they ever done a biopsy because at this point if you have used the topical for the cobitisol on there and it didn't go away then I would recommend yeah we'll need to do a biopsy to know for sure exactly and it doesn't look because patica it will be different you know and you wouldn't let me see your plate with count i know you saw the oncologists i can't get into the the plate are good, 260, so they would not, you know, I wouldn't, just, you know, that doesn't look like particular to me, because it's more like, patiquet will be more like blood-like. Yours is kind of spread out, it'll be smaller. That's why I was thinking that's what it was in back of my knees, because it kind of looks like that in back of my knees. Yeah, no, there is something else, but um i would yeah so i'll that one, we use over here Dr. Rothsch, I can't tell you if they do mask up or not but I believe if you ask them I think they would do you see they're right here 603 cranberry rule so be so per rash evaluate and treat I mean they're pretty good so 603 and she'll write it up cranberry road so that would be yeah that would be the recommendation because it it it doesn't it to me, yeah, it looks like, I mean, it's hyper pigment. because it's not it's not like a reddish it's almost like a brownish but the one here because normally for eczema it's normally in the areas like you see like in the back of the knee yeah I've never had it so but yeah so that's like on my arms and on my neck but I don't have on my neck in years yeah so the the recommended it will be yeah either would say the Derm because they could do a biopsy, because you said you've had this for how long? number of months so it's steadily gotten worse in the last couple of months it's gotten worse okay okay yeah so let's do that we'll do the dermatologist and let's see with this so so with your let me see let me put it so this was on June 17 right that you saw I just saw her to get the report but um like she did this this week okay oh yeah so it looks like July ate. Yeah. I mean, I wore the things last month. Okay, because the part of the dental part, you know, that's she'll, that's with her, right, for the bias. But she says, okay, so she said your airway is symmetrical. She said you do have hypertrophy of the tonsils. I mean, they're a little bit swollen. They're enlarged. So, and the adenoids are inwards. So, um... but she was saying the sinuses are okay. So with the tonsils and adenoids, that's behind, that's like an airnosed and throat, meaning that could be what's making you maybe not sweep or snore. For that, normally some people need to have that removed if it becomes a problem. That's part of like, you know, if it does show that you have sweep apnea and that will be an air nose and throat specialist have you seen one of those I have but only for like allergies and my sinus, well, I thought I had sinus problems and it turned out to be migraines. Yeah, because I was going to say the sinus here were okay. I've had my sinuses looked at and they're fine. But, you know, I have this. So she was trying to put together the big picture and she said, well, you've got migraines. And I said, well, I've had migraines since I went through puberty. But now they're changing, right? like in terms of like you started with just a headache but it's not right it's no i mean i've had migraines for i've been living with them for a long time and And the eulipta and the uberlvie generally work, you know, at least 80% of the time. And then she said, yeah, she said you have arthritis of the cervical spine. And I guess you also say that for you, I mean, did she send you to be evaluated by the dentist? She is the dentist. Oh, she is. Okay. Because she said there was a little bit of cavities i guess or oh the report was done by radiologists oh so then she goes all right right um I don't have cavities okay yeah because on here like she was saying recommend dental carries cannot be ruled out but I guess maybe it was the implant my whole dental situation is really good it's just that they didn't weren't able to see so yeah so they were saying that you had the hypertrophy of the tonsils the structure I way that, you know, makes the minimal position of the tongue, I think it's probably making your airway. be a little bit not compromised, right, because you're breathing, but, you know, they are saying however the rate of concerns exist, possibly underlying allergic should be considered, and auto-warangolaryngology evaluation can be considered which is the ear, nose, and throat to look. Normally they use that little varyngoscope and they go through the nose and they see the airway and then they say arthritis of the temperament they're joints and that's what she's working on that's this whole deal yeah sometimes they give you like some exercises right and don't chew like take big bites yeah i've had tm j for a really long time but my bite changed and that was what kind of prompted all this okay so the sleep study i don't have so is she just a referral to doctor knee for sleep study and hold off on tmj a bit after sleep study yeah i haven't seen dr knee i'm a little questioning about that because darkening is listed as a pediatrician. I don't seen Dr. Knee. I'm a little questioning about Dr. Ney, because Darkneed is listed as a pediatrician. Why don't... knee pediatrician yeah he's at st. Peters let me see I don't know is that a sleep specialist he's supposed to be I think she said people to him before he's seen Eastern Avenue I'm not sure but I know he's associated with st peters um dr samuel knee sweep study I mean, it's in here, it's fit Samuel Ney. It says he's the Children's Hospital at St. Peter's. Yeah, that's why I was questioning. I'm like, well, my insurance is going to say pediatrician, and that's not going to make any sense to them. Yeah, I guess I would just call them. I mean, it does say, it does look like he's, so I don't know him. Some people do adult, and I don't really know him. Some people do adult and pediatrics. I mean, so it does look, maybe, you know, he can have a specialty in both. He may be able to see both. I mean, but it does say pediatrics there. Yeah. But I think she would know that you wouldn't be considered, but they would have there, St. Peter's also has an adult, so maybe in the center where he's at, they have a adult, because they have a sleep center. But I wonder if, do you need to go see the um or the the ear nose and throat because the ear nose and throat they also order sleep studies if you need it so um i guess i would call her back because i mean she's you know really been thorough and i would just question like meaning you know she might know i don't know that specialist dr knee so it might or just call the office and ask them because it might be that he does both. Okay. And then, you know, know I don't know that specialist doctor knee so it might or just call the office and ask them because it might be that he does both okay and then you know you know, then you would be okay. Yeah. So, I mean, I think that's a good idea to rule out. But then part of it could be because of the tonsill, like the anatomy, like we said. And then the other thing, too, we may need to do some, I guess, exercises or therapy in order to see maybe like the posture and the strengthening of the cervical spine to help a little bit. I mean, that's not going to be, you know, that's going to be over time. but that can also help. Manessi can work with me on that if you give me a prescription for it. Yes, because she is not just an oncological lymphedema specialist. She does physical therapy. Yeah, she is all over physical therapy, but she also does spine stuff. Did we, yeah, so let me see. So where are primaries I'll do. I'll just put physical therapy, right? Because she's part of that. and because it does show a little bit like arthritis um okay so let's put um this will be physical therapy and then we'll put in here cervical yeah i do exercise some exercises that she gave me previously for that oh okay for things but you know it would be good to have a physical therapy yeah no that would be good and she could give you more yeah and it would be good too I guess we could give you if you want after she scans so we could give you this as a copy so she can have it too yes well I can email her okay yeah I can email her that yeah yeah I'll do that now yeah because that will be arthritis in the neck. Okay, so we'll put them. And so we'll put them and So per evaluate and treat Okay, all right, she'll print it out. Okay, so we'll print it out. Okay, so we'll do it away. So let's take it away so we'll do that and And then from your blood work, I know that you did a CBC, a CMP, with the oncologists, but from January, then, have you checked your cholesterol? No, and we also need to check my thyroid. Okay. So did you eat today or no? Today would be, I have, yeah, I had a banana, like two hours ago. Two hours ago, I mean, if it's just, I guess. I mean, it would be better if it was just fast. Fasting, that could influence slightly because remember your cholesterol was a little high last time. So I would like it to be fasting, fasting, meaning nothing past midnight the night before and just have water the day of. So I could have, either you could come back another time or are you seeing the oncologist and we'll pass it by there? Not many times soon no are you able to pass by like like monday tuesday uh not monday i can tell you that all i guess yeah next week wednesday thursday let me see my calendar uh i could uh when do i have it tuesday first thing in the morning like 8 a.m tuesday yeah i mean she's usually here in the way, like 8 a.m. Tuesday? Yeah, I mean she's usually here 8.10. You could come 8 a.m. but the lab before wives usually she's here 810 so that because you know and we've been doing a little bit with the lifestyle i mean i know your diet was pretty good but we want to trying to cut down a little bit um and then just more protein and the vegetables because it was slightly it's been high for a really long time um yeah it was 237 and the lL 144 the good thing is your sugar was good and there was no pre-diabetes. Okay. So I can come at 8.15. Would you be able to schedule it or? Tuesday, yeah. I'll tell the front, but technically normally you don't need to schedule. But, you know, we just let him know because I wrote it for today. So they'll pass it over. They put it over. Okay. For the Tuesday. Okay, so we'll do that. So we'll do the cholesterol plus the... The thyroid and I'll check, I don't think we'll checked your vitamin D or because it was a little high but then you cut it down a little bit right B the the D no B you want to do the B no vitamin D I need to take D in calcium to prevent osteoporosis yeah because you had osteopinia but from from a little bit was like in the 69 so we got to keep a night that doesn't get too high well the problem that you were interested in was B the B at January 10, right? Yeah. Yeah. So now I'm only taking B once a week. Okay. All right. So we'll check both because it's been since January. So it's been like over six months. I'm going to be taking high levels of vitamin D. Which is good, but we'll make sure that doesn't go over 100. Okay. That doesn't go too high. Okay, let me change that because we're touching your legs. and yeah because let me just look then again so in terms of here so the scans didn't really show anything right because it you know it would so it sounds you mean in terms of this thing yeah yeah so the swelling is just so like we had said before so it looks like it's kind of benign but if we want to kind of like have it more evaluated it would be the ear nose and throat that's just like a yeah because sometimes it could get like a sinus drainage there. Sometimes it could get a little pus. And you need to, it's like a pre-oricular tip. That was genetic. Someone in your family had that. Like either your mom, dad, usually like someone else has it. So it could get, sometimes it could get, like, infected. So usually you have to do like warm compresses. It is associated, but usually with hearing loss. How's your hearing then? I have a little hearing loss. I haven't been evaluated. Okay. So, that's just because like in PDA When we see a baby that has that, they do, I mean, normally they have the initial hearing loss anyway in the hospital, but usually they fall up, like, within three, six months for a repeat just to make sure. But usually it's benign, that little prerequisite of pay. But that must have been genetic. So that's not like something bad, but if you do again, like we could send you the ear nose and throat to make sure they do they have the audiologist usually within the group to do the hearing. And you may need them anyway eventually, especially because of the tonsils. And if we do have the sleep apnea, sometimes the treatment could be like either a mouth guard to kind of lower. Yeah, I wear a mouth guard already, but it's not for that. Okay, because it's just for the teeth, right? Okay, and she might have to change eventually because of the TMJ, right? Yeah, so I know it's kind of like, It's complex. It's not easy. So the... okay and she might have to change eventually because of the TMJ right yeah so I know it's kind of like it's complex it's not easy um so the dermatologist for sure because if you already been using that the high steroid cream and it's not helping then I can't really like tell you what it would be without most likely you know because usually they they probably would want to give you a steroid initially anyway too so you have to tell them that you've been on that and that they might need the biopsy and then since we are giving you then the um refer to dermatologist do you want us to do the ear nose and throat. We use here the E&T Associates of New Jersey they're over here on Cranberry Road and part of it they have like everything I mean they have the audiologist ear nose and throat and actually they do have an allergist Dr. Axelrod like within you know it's different different physicians but within the group they have the different specialties yeah i have to see if they're in my network okay so i'll give you the the uh referral uh yeah the the the names and the address uh with the referral then we'll check okay deep breath went out good breath right out good deep breath right out good deep breath right out and last one right out and you know i know you're using these but i was looking and they say i don't know if this is also making you kind of like leaning more forward with your neck I've had I know you're using these, but I was looking and I say, I don't know if this is also making you kind of like lean more forward with your neck? Pratt posture for a while. Okay. It's really, you know, carrying around 20 pounds of the extra weight. Yeah, so you don't take, like, having... Oh, no, this is new. This is new. Okay, so it's natural. Okay, yeah, because I'm going to say if you put that over, like, sometimes it would it weigh more? Okay. It's just a fan. I wear it temporarily. Okay, yeah, because like, do you see what I'm trying to say? Because if you put it on, I don't know if it will make you more. No, it's really, it's, it's boobs. It's having very heavy and lymphedina so well. Well, yeah,, it's boobs. It's having very heavy and lymphedina so well. Well, yeah, because of the web. side right yeah okay normal good and you go into the bathroom okay yeah okay and the legs now look good okay perfect so do you need a refill on the centroid um no that's automatic i think i've got some refills on there. You're doing the 75 once a day and you're waiting. waiting half an hour to eat. Yeah, yeah. I mean, I start my day really early at like 4.30. I don't eat until like 7. Okay, okay. So you're doing good. And yeah, so then your blood pressure is good. And your weight is staying stable. How much was it last time? It was 161.6. So it's basically the same. And then colonoscopy I think I've got another year but but I'm not sure. I see Deborah Goldstein. Goldstein, okay. We might end to get the report just to see. So we'll put in here. Doctor, okay. Goldstein, Deborah. Okay, so we'll put here. Yeah, it should be in there because it's St. Peter's. Yeah, I just added her to your provider. She wasn't in there. And I'll add this one, the doctor. wed work because um so you see w-e-d-d-l-e oh yeah so if you need a dentist she is the most thorough where is she at uh Warren oh okay okay it's a little up but you know yeah this is really this is really nice she is not kidding around no this is really good I mean I like the way and yeah thank you this is good we'll keep it on the this is like really informative like it should she took a ton of pictures i mean like she had her people do it but yeah i i had no idea what i was going into when i got there i thought i was just going to go see the dentist and no it's a good experience right oh yeah i all you want is someone who's thorough yeah you found out a lot of stuff not only when everything is kind of like does get together in terms of your TMJ and oral care because it's, you know, goes together. They should, it should be like of New Jersey so we'll put in here and then we'll do weft pre-orricular pre-orricular lesion and we'll put in it yeah so I've had it now for what like a good six months or so because you checked it the last time. Yeah, so you had, yeah. It's not like worse, right? Well, it's visible now. It wasn't visible before. Yeah, we'll do warm compresses too. And then you'll watch tons. Those will put, and we'll put also... So we evaluate and decrease hearing. You know, I don't know if it's really decreased or not. I've had hearing loss for a long time. But I would like to get it checked get it checked okay okay so let's do this then so we'll have you for Tuesday to come to do the blood work. I'll have Andrea do both for the dermatologist, for the rash, and then we'll do the ear, nose, and throat associates. And then I guess let's follow up with Dr. Wero in terms of Dr. Knee. If, you know, he does see adults too. If not, I know if you call St. Peter's, they do have an adult. It's a group. Sometimes it takes a while. We're not. We also use over here 593 Cranberry Road, but they're like the pulmonary, and they do have the Pomerary Associates of New Jersey, 593 Cranberry Road. It's not a sleep center, but they do have like sleep specialist, like a pulmonary that it does, you know, kind of specializing that. We use a sleep study, like a home sleep study. So, I mean, if those are dead ends is that different than what she had me do it's like you wear a thing a watch kind of thing on your wrist I don't know which one she had, because mine actually shows in terms of, it's not in here, mine actually, for the sleep study, it actually gives you the desaturation and gives you if you have sleep apnea or not. It doesn't look like hers did, or else she would have told you, you wouldn't need to go see a specialist. So you see what, so i'll give you the information on it because if anything we can order that home sweep study i think mine is different the one she ordered on hers here she didn't really mention that she just had referred you yeah it was just like to you know wear a wrist thing and then there was a ring and it was just basically pulse oxymeters yeah so if she didn't check the desaturation right because she says so it wasn't a sweep study, sweep study, per se. um she was just looking at your sweep's pattern um so when you order one of those where do you get it from it's a company blackstone they send it to your house oh okay and you wear it for 24 hours and then you send it back and then when you send it back they evaluate it and then they give you they give you the reading um So, yeah, so hers was looking more of oxymetry. She wasn't looking in terms of how many hours, right, like you were sleeping. So it's not exactly a sleep study. Because insurance wouldn't cover another one. So she, it wasn't. So I'll give me- Well, the insurance barely covered this, but it was, you know, it wasn't under my healthcare stuff. It was under my dental. Okay. I have to pay a huge amount of money for all of this. Oh, I understand. Okay, yeah. So I'll give you the information. If the sweep study is a dead end, we can then have you do our home sweep study. But regardless, though, let's see then the dermatologist and the ear, nose, and throat associates you. Maybe have you come back in two months, because it will give you kind of time to see if you do see the sleep study specialist and the dermatologist and the urnose and throat okay all right Okay, so very good. A lot of stuff, huh? I know."", 'diarized_transcript_csv_url': ''}"

ASSESSMENT:
Multiple squamous cell carcinomas and basal cell carcinomas
Patient has extensive history of skin cancers treated with various modalities including surgical excision and radiation therapy. Currently has a concerning ulcerated squamous cell carcinoma on left lower leg that is not amenable to radiation per Dr. Shimuzu who will not treat below the knee. Patient has had difficulty with surgical excisions due to being on blood thinners for heart failure and experiencing excessive bleeding and poor healing. 

Field cancerization
Recently underwent blue light therapy to scalp and face with significant skin inflammation. Recently prescribed Acitretin but has not begun taking it due to concerns about alcohol interaction. 

Heart failure
Diagnosed in 2017, has defibrillator in place. Currently on Entresto and blood thinners. Followed by Dr. Chang at Scripps.


RECOMMENDATION/PLAN:
Will contact Dr. Richards to discuss surgical options for the left lower leg lesion.
If surgery is not an option, will proceed with immunotherapy which would be administered every 3 weeks for at least one year.
Discussed cemiplimab with expected 60-70% response rate for squamous cell carcinomas but slower response for basal cell carcinomas. Reviewed potential side effects including skin rash or pruritus, fatigue, thyroid dysfunction, and rare but serious complications like pneumonitis.
Immunotherapy would likely address multiple lesions simultaneously.
No anticipated interactions between immunotherapy and current cardiac medications.
Patient should establish regular follow-up with primary care physician given multiple medical conditions.
Patient to continue with current dermatologic care for field cancerization including blue light therapy and consideration of Acitretin.

It is a pleasure to take care of Mr. Grimm.

",,"Skin cancers for a number of years. Yes. And she's cut a lot of them off of you over the years. Yeah. And you've had radiation to some. Mm-hmm. It sounds like the wrinkle lately is that you had to start blood thinners in December? No, I've been on them for a few years. Oh, okay. Yeah, probably seven or eight. Oh, seven or eight years. years you've been off of them when I go into Sear because she makes me bleed. Yes, yeah. Okay. Yeah, because her notes had said something about not being able to do mose because of the blood thinners, and I thought, we'll just stop the blood thinners for a couple of years. Yeah, I still bleed even before I call myself a bleeder, but she didn't. Between her trying to clean the blood out while she's operating, it wasn't easy. Yeah. And then the last hue on my face that she did her on my hair. head, um, the painkiller wouldn't stop. I mean, it, it was just unbearable. She put in five times the normal amount to get dead in the area. And she hit it in a minute she started just. So after that, then I started doing radiation on some of them. And, uh, then I've got one here. And then Thank you. a couple on my arm, and Dr. Shimuzu, who was doing the radiation, says he won't do radiation below the elbow or below the knee. So he did, we finished this one a month ago. It's not quite healed yet, but, and then he said he won't do that one. Okay. And so, um, and Dr. Richards can't cut that one off? I think she could, or someone could. Thank you. okay yeah and I don't have I mean I guess when you get older I've got neuropathy and I don't have a lot of feeling but the ones that she's cut off before took a while to heal yeah I mean things on the lower extremities tend not to heal super well because your circulation's not great right you know even even people with relatively good circulation things heal slower down there Thank you. Yeah. And if you have some trouble with your circulation, then that can certainly magnify that. So what are the most problematic areas right now? So the left lower leg there. This one was about that size. We started the radiation, and this is similar. I can take this off. Yeah. Let's have a look there. And I might take a picture for my chart. Right. Can I throw this here? I try and keep it covered. Yeah. Are you putting anything on it right now? Yeah, Mew, it's a salve. Okay. Meepierison, maybe? Yeah, that's right. Oh, right. And I don't know, is there something else better to do than that one? I mean, that's an antibiotic cream. Thank you. it will it will keep it from getting infected it's not going to do anything about the cancer there though this allows me to this allows me to put the photo right into your chart. without having to save it anywhere, which is nice. I don't have my measuring thing with me. All right, so there's that guy. I've got this here and here. They've been there for over a year. Okay. She did five biopsies. It was here, here, here, here. Thank you. I think this one maybe six recently. Okay. And they all came back, squamous cell. Okay. And this guy, this looks more like a basil cell, but it's not really specific looking. Do you remember if that one was a basal cell or a squamous cell? They told me all of them were squamous. But, you know, I don't know. Yeah, let's see. The last one, actually Dr. Shemizo's note kind of had the best summer. Thank you. of everything. Let's see here. So the latest crop, they biopsyed a bunch of them in March. Chest with squamous cell. One of the ones on the right forearm is a basal cell. Right radial dorsal hand is basal cell. Okay. Right ulnar dorsal hand. Thank you. so this one out here that one's squamous cell and they said it was in sight to when they biopsied it right thigh was a squamous cell left upper back basil cell let me see if I've got one on the left lower leg was this from Shamos? That was from Shemuzzo's note yeah they just did she just did five of them two weeks ago Thank you. And then they called me with the results. They said they were all squamous cell, but this one, this one. Okay. I thought she did these two. Okay. So the left lower leg is a squamous cell, is what she told you. Yeah, because she sent the, I see the procedure note from when she did all of those biopsies. but I think she sent the referral before the... pathology came in. Right. I'll have to follow up and get that back. Okay. Yeah. So I know you saw Dr. Bolin a couple of years ago to talk about the possibility of starting immunotherapy or some kind of systemic therapy to try to address these, and she felt like it wasn't quite right at that time. So what we use systemic therapy for, what it's approved for, is if you have locally advanced skin cancers that cannot be addressed any other way, either with radiation or with surgery. If they can be addressed that way, that's still the best thing. And I think, I don't know, this one on the leg looks pretty gnarly. Have you seen anyone other than Dr. Richards and Dr. Shemezu about that one? No? Okay. So no other surgeons have been involved. and so my just have to call Dr. Richards and talk through this with her a little bit, because I feel like that one potentially could be addressed surgically, but maybe there's something about this that I don't know. There's some reason why they can't just send you to a plastic surgeon or some of their kind of surgeon to remove that. As you know, you've got to come off blood thinners temporarily for anything like that but that's that's doable I understand that mose on the scalp and face is not really working out anymore it sounds like you're not getting effective pain relief from the injections anymore is there anything now your skin looks pretty inflamed right now is she have you putting something on that she did a blue light on Friday oh she blew light Friday okay so she said it'd be 10 days or so it'll be Thank you. Okay. Looking pretty bad. And then you're also on a medication three times a week, the Acetretton? I haven't taken it. Oh, okay. I just got it. She just put me on it. Oh, okay. I just picked it up the other day, but when I read all the, read about it, I've had heart failure. And then also, and that's the reason I'm on blood thinners. Um But that was eight years ago, and I'm still here, so thankful about that. Yeah. But when I read on that, I have two glasses of wine every night. That helps me relax and go to sleep. And we live in a vineyard, so I've been a wine drinker all my life. And it says you can't drink any alcohol with that. And I don't know whether that's the truth. I mean, most of them say don't drink. and drive and all that. Yeah, yeah. But I'm not going to stop my alcohol just to take this. And when I say that, unless it's a matter of life or death, I don't know, is this going to help me enough to offset, you know, something I enjoy? Yeah. So, I mean, I don't think it's an absolute. I think the combination probably increases the risk of liver toxicity. And Thank you. And so you just have to monitor that. The idea behind that medication is that it would slow the development of these skin cancers and reduce the need for her to cut on you. Right. Okay. And that's a good thing to try to do whenever possible, you know, do a preventative approach. So what I have to offer is really for the treatment of advanced skin cancers. Okay. I think this one on your leg would probably qualify if it truly is not resectable. Are there any other significant skin cancers right now besides the ones you've shown me? So it's mostly the arms and legs right now. Yeah. And there's one in the back, which I think she did that just as a precaution. And because when I was with Shemizu, he said, I'm not going to do that when you're not ready to have. Thank you. that one radiated. Yeah, so they're kind of just watching that one. Yeah. Yeah. But yeah, I think what she's doing with the, you know, with the blue light and have you also done the 5FU cream? No. No? Okay, so we haven't even gotten to those things yet. But yeah, it looks like the blue light did a pretty good job for you. Yeah, I felt it. Uh-huh. Yeah, your skin's pretty, pretty inflamed right now. So hopefully over the next Thank you. week or two here that will all kind of it'll probably a lot of it'll peel and um okay and then it'll be a little smoother after that um so yeah those kind of treatments are definitely the best kinds of preventive treatments um so it's good that she's doing all of that stuff so um if this one on your leg is not amenable to a surgical approach and dr shemizu says we can't radiate it um Thank you. then we could talk about immunotherapy. And so before I jump into that, let me at least run through the rest of your medical history here. Okay. Because I know there's quite a bit going on there. So you mentioned that you have a history of heart failure. Did you have a heart attack in the past? No, I just had heart failure. Okay. Just had heart failure. Okay. Did they know what paused it? No. My family history is, Thank you. that died of weak hearts based on what I know and so I've and my brother just had a heart transplant and he's seven years younger than I am he had a heart that was he needed a new one to live I see so but I don't know what caused it or outside of and that was diagnosed around 2017 yes okay and And do you have like a pacemaker or anything like that? I have a defibrillator. Defibrillator, okay. And I got that at that time. Okay. All right. And you've really been on blood thinners then kind of since that time? Right. All right. And I see, yeah, you're on intresto for the CHF. Who is your cardiologist, by the way? Oh, a new one, Dr. Chang. Okay. Thank you. At Scripps. Okay. All right. And then diabetes you've had since 2010, and you mentioned you've got some neuropathy from that? Yeah, I've had neuropathy for, I think, 20 years. Okay. I don't have a lot of feeling in my feet. Yeah. Any other complications from the diabetes that you know of, like kidney trouble or? Not so. more um who's primary care for you um i haven't been to a primary care physician and it was dr brunston insidus but i don't i think someone took over his practice oh goodness somebody with this many medical problems needs a primary care doctor okay um who's managing your diabetes um i get prescription renewals uh maybe was through dr Thank you. office. I just don't remember the last time I was there was three years ago. Oh, geez. That's not okay. Well, I do have, I've been seen Dr. Pearlman, have been in Dr. Pearlman's office in Santee. Okay. I guess I, I do have someone I've been going to now and then, and they give me the diabetic treatment. Okay. So somebody at Perlman Clinic is sort of. I'm on Mojaro. Yes. Thank you. Okay. And Farsiga as well? Farksiga, yeah. It was recommended by my cardiologist. Okay. And then it looks like you're on, so just some vitamins and supplements and things. Beyond that. Okay. And the only allergy is penicillin. Never smoker. A couple glasses of wine a day. any other major medical history I should be aware of, surgeries, hospitalizations, nothing like that. I've been in the hospital three times since 2017 with heart. Heart believing stuff. Yeah. Okay. Is that usually over at scripts when you do get? Yeah. Okay. All righty. I had a fall. I was actually in, that was two years ago. I hit my head pretty bad, and I went to, Thank you. Sharp for that. I forgot about that. And then, let's see. And so you live over? I live in Lakeside. Lakeside, okay. And Dr. Bruntz was the PCP before? Yeah, he was the one before. How do you spell that? B-R-U. Thank you. N-T-Z or S-T, Brunst, B-R-U-S-T. N-S-T. Okay. Great. I just want to make sure you've plugged in with care for all that stuff. And then in terms of family history, it sounds like just mostly cardiac stuff. Both parents had heart failure, brother had a heart transplant. is there any family history of cancer at all? No, not really. Not really? Okay. All righty. Yeah, so immunotherapy. If we were going to consider that, that is an IV medication that you get once every three weeks. And it does work really well for squamous-type skin cancers. We see about a 60 to 70% response rate. Thank you. which is quite good, and it works fairly quickly. If it works, you know, it could clear up this lesion here probably within a few months. It works okay on basal cells as well, but it's much, much slower, so it can take many more months to really see a change on a basil, which is important since you have a mix of both of those things, some of these spots are going to rest. Thank you. respond really well to that and some of them might not so much. So it is very different than chemotherapy in that chemotherapy, you get the medication, it causes side effects rather predictably within the first week or so, and then those side effects kind of dissipate as the medication leaves your system. Amynotherapy works with your immune system to get your immune system to fight cancer. And so the side effects are on. predictable because it relies on how your immune system responds. So seven out of ten people will cruise through immunotherapy with very mild side effects or even no side effects. And some of the stuff that we see commonly, we see skin dryness, rashes, itching fairly commonly. We also see some patients just feel slightly fatigued after their infusions. Usually it's pretty Thank you. pretty minor. And that seems to just last a day or two. And then not infrequently, we have thyroid problems associated with it. Probably as many as 10% of patients will end up developing hypothyroidism and have to go on a thyroid pill. And that's because the immune system can attack the thyroid gland. And that is not reversible. So a lot of the other side effects will go away once you come off the treatment. But if it attacks the thyroid or the adrenal gland or your pancreas, then you're forever dependent on some sort of hormone replacement from that. And that's an important thing to know. Other side effects that can occur with immunotherapy, so it's pretty wild because it can be, you know, it can be anything from no side effects to people have died from the side effects and everything in between. So rarely people can have more serious side effects like inflammation of the lungs or the liver. Lung is fairly common with these. That one is significant enough that it needs treatment, maybe 3% of patients, which doesn't sound like a big number, but we use a lot of this. So I've certainly seen my share of pneumonitis with it. most of those side effects If they're really mild, like if you get a skin rash, for example, we'll give you some cream to manage it and things like that if it's mild and we'll kind of try to carry on with the treatment. If it's more significant, like if you get inflammation in your lungs, we pause the treatment and we usually will put you on steroids for a little while to cool the immune system back down. And most of the time that is successful. Occasionally the immune system gets so revved up that we have to use special medications. to calm it down. So these treatments have been a real game changer for a lot of cancers. And for guys with really advanced skin cancers where there's not other good options for them, they can be a really important tool in our toolbox. And most people sail through these treatments with little to no side effects. But it is important to know that for a small percentage of patients, some really bad stuff can happen. So we don't use them. Thank you. lightly. Okay. So this is used for all different kinds of cancers? Yeah, we use immunotherapy for lots of things. The first thing that we used it for a lot was actually melanoma, which is a very immune-driven kind of cancer. And so most of what we know about immunotherapy, we learned from melanoma. But it's used in kidney cancer, lung cancer, GI cancer. There's a lot of different cancers. Now we're using immunotherapy. Thank you. But yeah, we really, we really just use it when local therapies have failed or no longer an option. And we may be sort of approaching that with you. I think the big question is really this one on your leg here. It looks like that's been there for a pretty long time. Probably six months. Yeah. Not, I mean, it started like that. Yeah. Yeah. And now it's all ulcerated in the middle. Yeah. And when he took this off, it was just like this. Actually, this one would bigger than that one. Yeah. Okay. So I think I can justify a trial of immunotherapy for this one if Dr. Richards says that surgery, and it wouldn't be a Mose, it would be like having you see a surgeon. If she says that that's not an option, then I think we could consider it. What would you think about that? I'd be okay with it, but if it can be a surgeon. Thank you. can get rid of it. Now, if one on the immunotherapy, it would take care of everything, right? Yeah, so it would probably work on a lot of these other spots as well. Okay, so we'd clean them all up at the same time. You'd need to probably stay on it for at least a year. So coming in every three weeks for a year, which is a little bit of a pain. That's not bad. It was 15 straight days on the radiation. Thank you. No, it was 22 days in a row. Yeah. I've done that five times now. Okay. So, I can deal with once every three weeks or whatever. Yeah. Okay. All right, so I'll talk to Dr. Richards and get her thoughts about that one in particular. And... Is there any issues with immunotherapy and my heart failure or these medications? There shouldn't be. Okay. No. Cardiac side effects from immunotherapy extremely rare. Thank you. And none of these things should really interact with it because none of them are immunosuppressive or anything like that. So it should be fine. Now, you mentioned that you're kind of a bleeder even before you started on the elegance? No, just since my heart failure. Just since the heart failure. Okay, that makes sense. Before that, yeah, because I'd never been on any medications. Okay, okay. I just wanted to make sure that wasn't something we needed to accept. Thank you. explore a little bit more. But yeah, now since the heart failure, you've been on blood thinning medications. And I don't know if any of the stuff you're on is like if you have, if you're on fish oil or omega-3s or any of that, that can do a little bit too. Yeah, I don't do the fish oil and then I know I'm going to have surgery. Yeah. Yeah, because that, uh, uh, people underestimate that one, but that can really make you bleed. Yeah. Well, I was doing fish oil and... the, um, whatever else I was taking and, yeah, eloquists. Yeah, uh-huh. Yeah, those together, you're probably just one giant bruise, huh? Yeah. Yeah. All right, come on up here. I'm going to do a quick look over you. Thank you. Not find the lens anywhere, which is good. Thank you. That sounds okay, couple deep breaths. Good, it looks out all right. Let me take a little bit more of a look here. I'm going to look at your back. Okay, you've got a lot of seborriac keratosis as well. these kind of barnacles. everywhere. Those guys are benign. They're just annoying. You got a really good one right there. And then this bandage in the middle of your back here, this was another biopsy she did. Oh yeah, it's still under the bandage. Uh-huh. Oh, okay. Do you want me to take it off? Yeah, you can take it off. I could, uh. Yeah, that's healed up all right. Okay. Thank you. All right. Let me take a look at your trunk. Okay, good. Thank you. Yeah, I see a few up here. So this one here, did he radiate this one on your upper left chest? No. He did one on the right side, I think. Right. Which I cannot easily see. I think it was right under. In this area somewhere? It's right in here. Yeah, it's a little bit pink and you've lost the hair, so I'm guessing that it was right in there. So it looks like that did a good job for you. Yeah, you got a little bit of a rash going under here. And then you've got something here. Was this another skin cancer there or just something else? Okay. Something else. Okay. All right. You can put that down. All right. That gives me a pretty good idea what we're dealing with. Okay. Okay. So I'll reach out to Dr. Richards and we'll kind of just chat through your case. And if she thinks surgery is a bad idea for this, then we'll set you up for some immunotherapy. Okay. Thank you. Okay, sounds good. All right. Nice to meet you. That's it for today, yes, sir. I'll give you a call and let you know what she has to say about that.",new,"- CPT Code: 11100

Yes. And she\'s cut a lot of them off of you over the years. Yeah. And you\'ve had radiation to some. Mm-hmm. It sounds like the wrinkle lately is that you had to start blood thinners in December? No, I\'ve been on them for a few years. Oh, okay. Yeah, probably seven or eight. Oh, seven or eight years. years you\'ve been off of them when I go into Sear because she makes me bleed. Yes, yeah. Okay. Yeah, because her notes had said something about not being able to do mose because of the blood thinners, and I thought, we\'ll just stop the blood thinners for a couple of years. Yeah, I still bleed even before I call myself a bleeder, but she didn\'t. Between her trying to clean the blood out while she\'s operating, it wasn\'t easy. Yeah. And then the last hue on my face that she did her on my hair. head, um, the painkiller wouldn\'t stop. I mean, it, it was just unbearable. She put in five times the normal amount to get dead in the area. And she hit it in a minute she started just. So after that, then I started doing radiation on some of them. And, uh, then I\'ve got one here. And then Thank you. a couple on my arm, and Dr. Shimuzu, who was doing the radiation, says he won\'t do radiation below the elbow or below the knee. So he did, we finished this one a month ago. It\'s not quite healed yet, but, and then he said he won\'t do that one. Okay. And so, um, and Dr. Richards can\'t cut that one off? I think she could, or someone could. Thank you. okay yeah and I don\'t have I mean I guess when you get older I\'ve got neuropathy and I don\'t have a lot of feeling but the ones that she\'s cut off before took a while to heal yeah I mean things on the lower extremities tend not to heal super well because your circulation\'s not great right you know even even people with relatively good circulation things heal slower down there Thank you. Yeah. And if you have some trouble with your circulation, then that can certainly magnify that. So what are the most problematic areas right now? So the left lower leg there. This one was about that size. We started the radiation, and this is similar. I can take this off. Yeah. Let\'s have a look there. And I might take a picture for my chart. Right. Can I throw this here? I try and keep it covered. Yeah. Are you putting anything on it right now? Yeah, Mew, it\'s a salve. Okay. Meepierison, maybe? Yeah, that\'s right. Oh, right. And I don\'t know, is there something else better to do than that one? I mean, that\'s an antibiotic cream. Thank you. it will it will keep it from getting infected it\'s not going to do anything about the cancer there though this allows me to this allows me to put the photo right into your chart. without having to save it anywhere, which is nice. I don\'t have my measuring thing with me. All right, so there\'s that guy. I\'ve got this here and here. They\'ve been there for over a year. Okay. She did five biopsies. It was here, here, here, here. Thank you. I think this one maybe six recently. Okay. And they all came back, squamous cell. Okay. And this guy, this looks more like a basil cell, but it\'s not really specific looking. Do you remember if that one was a basal cell or a squamous cell? They told me all of them were squamous. But, you know, I don\'t know. Yeah, let\'s see. The last one, actually Dr. Shemizo\'s note kind of had the best summer. Thank you. of everything. Let\'s see here. So the latest crop, they biopsyed a bunch of them in March. Chest with squamous cell. One of the ones on the right forearm is a basal cell. Right radial dorsal hand is basal cell. Okay. Right ulnar dorsal hand. Thank you. so this one out here that one\'s squamous cell and they said it was in sight to when they biopsied it right thigh was a squamous cell left upper back basil cell let me see if I\'ve got one on the left lower leg was this from Shamos? That was from Shemuzzo\'s note yeah they just did she just did five of them two weeks ago Thank you. And then they called me with the results. They said they were all squamous cell, but this one, this one. Okay. I thought she did these two. Okay. So the left lower leg is a squamous cell, is what she told you. Yeah, because she sent the, I see the procedure note from when she did all of those biopsies. but I think she sent the referral before the... pathology came in. Right. I\'ll have to follow up and get that back. Okay. Yeah. So I know you saw Dr. Bolin a couple of years ago to talk about the possibility of starting immunotherapy or some kind of systemic therapy to try to address these, and she felt like it wasn\'t quite right at that time. So what we use systemic therapy for, what it\'s approved for, is if you have locally advanced skin cancers that cannot be addressed any other way, either with radiation or with surgery. If they can be addressed that way, that\'s still the best thing. And I think, I don\'t know, this one on the leg looks pretty gnarly. Have you seen anyone other than Dr. Richards and Dr. Shemezu about that one? No? Okay. So no other surgeons have been involved. and so my just have to call Dr. Richards and talk through this with her a little bit, because I feel like that one potentially could be addressed surgically, but maybe there\'s something about this that I don\'t know. There\'s some reason why they can\'t just send you to a plastic surgeon or some of their kind of surgeon to remove that. As you know, you\'ve got to come off blood thinners temporarily for anything like that but that\'s that\'s doable I understand that mose on the scalp and face is not really working out anymore it sounds like you\'re not getting effective pain relief from the injections anymore is there anything now your skin looks pretty inflamed right now is she have you putting something on that she did a blue light on Friday oh she blew light Friday okay so she said it\'d be 10 days or so it\'ll be Thank you. Okay. Looking pretty bad. And then you\'re also on a medication three times a week, the Acetretton? I haven\'t taken it. Oh, okay. I just got it. She just put me on it. Oh, okay. I just picked it up the other day, but when I read all the, read about it, I\'ve had heart failure. And then also, and that\'s the reason I\'m on blood thinners. Um But that was eight years ago, and I\'m still here, so thankful about that. Yeah. But when I read on that, I have two glasses of wine every night. That helps me relax and go to sleep. And we live in a vineyard, so I\'ve been a wine drinker all my life. And it says you can\'t drink any alcohol with that. And I don\'t know whether that\'s the truth. I mean, most of them say don\'t drink. and drive and all that. Yeah, yeah. But I\'m not going to stop my alcohol just to take this. And when I say that, unless it\'s a matter of life or death, I don\'t know, is this going to help me enough to offset, you know, something I enjoy? Yeah. So, I mean, I don\'t think it\'s an absolute. I think the combination probably increases the risk of liver toxicity. And Thank you. And so you just have to monitor that. The idea behind that medication is that it would slow the development of these skin cancers and reduce the need for her to cut on you. Right. Okay. And that\'s a good thing to try to do whenever possible, you know, do a preventative approach. So what I have to offer is really for the treatment of advanced skin cancers. Okay. I think this one on your leg would probably qualify if it truly is not resectable. Are there any other significant skin cancers right now besides the ones you\'ve shown me? So it\'s mostly the arms and legs right now. Yeah. And there\'s one in the back, which I think she did that just as a precaution. And because when I was with Shemizu, he said, I\'m not going to do that when you\'re not ready to have. Thank you. that one radiated. Yeah, so they\'re kind of just watching that one. Yeah. Yeah. But yeah, I think what she\'s doing with the, you know, with the blue light and have you also done the 5FU cream? No. No? Okay, so we haven\'t even gotten to those things yet. But yeah, it looks like the blue light did a pretty good job for you. Yeah, I felt it. Uh-huh. Yeah, your skin\'s pretty, pretty inflamed right now. So hopefully over the next Thank you. week or two here that will all kind of it\'ll probably a lot of it\'ll peel and um okay and then it\'ll be a little smoother after that um so yeah those kind of treatments are definitely the best kinds of preventive treatments um so it\'s good that she\'s doing all of that stuff so um if this one on your leg is not amenable to a surgical approach and dr shemizu says we can\'t radiate it um Thank you. then we could talk about immunotherapy. And so before I jump into that, let me at least run through the rest of your medical history here. Okay. Because I know there\'s quite a bit going on there. So you mentioned that you have a history of heart failure. Did you have a heart attack in the past? No, I just had heart failure. Okay. Just had heart failure. Okay. Did they know what paused it? No. My family history is, Thank you. that died of weak hearts based on what I know and so I\'ve and my brother just had a heart transplant and he\'s seven years younger than I am he had a heart that was he needed a new one to live I see so but I don\'t know what caused it or outside of and that was diagnosed around 2017 yes okay and And do you have like a pacemaker or anything like that? I have a defibrillator. Defibrillator, okay. And I got that at that time. Okay. All right. And you\'ve really been on blood thinners then kind of since that time? Right. All right. And I see, yeah, you\'re on intresto for the CHF. Who is your cardiologist, by the way? Oh, a new one, Dr. Chang. Okay. Thank you. At Scripps. Okay. All right. And then diabetes you\'ve had since 2010, and you mentioned you\'ve got some neuropathy from that? Yeah, I\'ve had neuropathy for, I think, 20 years. Okay. I don\'t have a lot of feeling in my feet. Yeah. Any other complications from the diabetes that you know of, like kidney trouble or? Not so. more um who\'s primary care for you um i haven\'t been to a primary care physician and it was dr brunston insidus but i don\'t i think someone took over his practice oh goodness somebody with this many medical problems needs a primary care doctor okay um who\'s managing your diabetes um i get prescription renewals uh maybe was through dr Thank you. office. I just don\'t remember the last time I was there was three years ago. Oh, geez. That\'s not okay. Well, I do have, I\'ve been seen Dr. Pearlman, have been in Dr. Pearlman\'s office in Santee. Okay. I guess I, I do have someone I\'ve been going to now and then, and they give me the diabetic treatment. Okay. So somebody at Perlman Clinic is sort of. I\'m on Mojaro. Yes. Thank you. Okay. And Farsiga as well? Farksiga, yeah. It was recommended by my cardiologist. Okay. And then it looks like you\'re on, so just some vitamins and supplements and things. Beyond that. Okay. And the only allergy is penicillin. Never smoker. A couple glasses of wine a day. any other major medical history I should be aware of, surgeries, hospitalizations, nothing like that. I\'ve been in the hospital three times since 2017 with heart. Heart believing stuff. Yeah. Okay. Is that usually over at scripts when you do get? Yeah. Okay. All righty. I had a fall. I was actually in, that was two years ago. I hit my head pretty bad, and I went to, Thank you. Sharp for that. I forgot about that. And then, let\'s see. And so you live over? I live in Lakeside. Lakeside, okay. And Dr. Bruntz was the PCP before? Yeah, he was the one before. How do you spell that? B-R-U. Thank you. N-T-Z or S-T, Brunst, B-R-U-S-T. N-S-T. Okay. Great. I just want to make sure you\'ve plugged in with care for all that stuff. And then in terms of family history, it sounds like just mostly cardiac stuff. Both parents had heart failure, brother had a heart transplant. is there any family history of cancer at all? No, not really. Not really? Okay. All righty. Yeah, so immunotherapy. If we were going to consider that, that is an IV medication that you get once every three weeks. And it does work really well for squamous-type skin cancers. We see about a 60 to 70% response rate. Thank you. which is quite good, and it works fairly quickly. If it works, you know, it could clear up this lesion here probably within a few months. It works okay on basal cells as well, but it\'s much, much slower, so it can take many more months to really see a change on a basil, which is important since you have a mix of both of those things, some of these spots are going to rest. Thank you. respond really well to that and some of them might not so much. So it is very different than chemotherapy in that chemotherapy, you get the medication, it causes side effects rather predictably within the first week or so, and then those side effects kind of dissipate as the medication leaves your system. Amynotherapy works with your immune system to get your immune system to fight cancer. And so the side effects are on. predictable because it relies on how your immune system responds. So seven out of ten people will cruise through immunotherapy with very mild side effects or even no side effects. And some of the stuff that we see commonly, we see skin dryness, rashes, itching fairly commonly. We also see some patients just feel slightly fatigued after their infusions. Usually it\'s pretty Thank you. pretty minor. And that seems to just last a day or two. And then not infrequently, we have thyroid problems associated with it. Probably as many as 10% of patients will end up developing hypothyroidism and have to go on a thyroid pill. And that\'s because the immune system can attack the thyroid gland. And that is not reversible. So a lot of the other side effects will go away once you come off the treatment. But if it attacks the thyroid or the adrenal gland or your pancreas, then you\'re forever dependent on some sort of hormone replacement from that. And that\'s an important thing to know. Other side effects that can occur with immunotherapy, so it\'s pretty wild because it can be, you know, it can be anything from no side effects to people have died from the side effects and everything in between. So rarely people can have more serious side effects like inflammation of the lungs or the liver. Lung is fairly common with these. That one is significant enough that it needs treatment, maybe 3% of patients, which doesn\'t sound like a big number, but we use a lot of this. So I\'ve certainly seen my share of pneumonitis with it. most of those side effects If they\'re really mild, like if you get a skin rash, for example, we\'ll give you some cream to manage it and things like that if it\'s mild and we\'ll kind of try to carry on with the treatment. If it\'s more significant, like if you get inflammation in your lungs, we pause the treatment and we usually will put you on steroids for a little while to cool the immune system back down. And most of the time that is successful. Occasionally the immune system gets so revved up that we have to use special medications. to calm it down. So these treatments have been a real game changer for a lot of cancers. And for guys with really advanced skin cancers where there\'s not other good options for them, they can be a really important tool in our toolbox. And most people sail through these treatments with little to no side effects. But it is important to know that for a small percentage of patients, some really bad stuff can happen. So we don\'t use them. Thank you. lightly. Okay. So this is used for all different kinds of cancers? Yeah, we use immunotherapy for lots of things. The first thing that we used it for a lot was actually melanoma, which is a very immune-driven kind of cancer. And so most of what we know about immunotherapy, we learned from melanoma. But it\'s used in kidney cancer, lung cancer, GI cancer. There\'s a lot of different cancers. Now we\'re using immunotherapy. Thank you. But yeah, we really, we really just use it when local therapies have failed or no longer an option. And we may be sort of approaching that with you. I think the big question is really this one on your leg here. It looks like that\'s been there for a pretty long time. Probably six months. Yeah. Not, I mean, it started like that. Yeah. Yeah. And now it\'s all ulcerated in the middle. Yeah. And when he took this off, it was just like this. Actually, this one would bigger than that one. Yeah. Okay. So I think I can justify a trial of immunotherapy for this one if Dr. Richards says that surgery, and it wouldn\'t be a Mose, it would be like having you see a surgeon. If she says that that\'s not an option, then I think we could consider it. What would you think about that? I\'d be okay with it, but if it can be a surgeon. Thank you. can get rid of it. Now, if one on the immunotherapy, it would take care of everything, right? Yeah, so it would probably work on a lot of these other spots as well. Okay, so we\'d clean them all up at the same time. You\'d need to probably stay on it for at least a year. So coming in every three weeks for a year, which is a little bit of a pain. That\'s not bad. It was 15 straight days on the radiation. Thank you. No, it was 22 days in a row. Yeah. I\'ve done that five times now. Okay. So, I can deal with once every three weeks or whatever. Yeah. Okay. All right, so I\'ll talk to Dr. Richards and get her thoughts about that one in particular. And... Is there any issues with immunotherapy and my heart failure or these medications? There shouldn\'t be. Okay. No. Cardiac side effects from immunotherapy extremely rare. Thank you. And none of these things should really interact with it because none of them are immunosuppressive or anything like that. So it should be fine. Now, you mentioned that you\'re kind of a bleeder even before you started on the elegance? No, just since my heart failure. Just since the heart failure. Okay, that makes sense. Before that, yeah, because I\'d never been on any medications. Okay, okay. I just wanted to make sure that wasn\'t something we needed to accept. Thank you. explore a little bit more. But yeah, now since the heart failure, you\'ve been on blood thinning medications. And I don\'t know if any of the stuff you\'re on is like if you have, if you\'re on fish oil or omega-3s or any of that, that can do a little bit too. Yeah, I don\'t do the fish oil and then I know I\'m going to have surgery. Yeah. Yeah, because that, uh, uh, people underestimate that one, but that can really make you bleed. Yeah. Well, I was doing fish oil and... the, um, whatever else I was taking and, yeah, eloquists. Yeah, uh-huh. Yeah, those together, you\'re probably just one giant bruise, huh? Yeah. Yeah. All right, come on up here. I\'m going to do a quick look over you. Thank you. Not find the lens anywhere, which is good. Thank you. That sounds okay, couple deep breaths. Good, it looks out all right. Let me take a little bit more of a look here. I\'m going to look at your back. Okay, you\'ve got a lot of seborriac keratosis as well. these kind of barnacles. everywhere. Those guys are benign. They\'re just annoying. You got a really good one right there. And then this bandage in the middle of your back here, this was another biopsy she did. Oh yeah, it\'s still under the bandage. Uh-huh. Oh, okay. Do you want me to take it off? Yeah, you can take it off. I could, uh. Yeah, that\'s healed up all right. Okay. Thank you. All right. Let me take a look at your trunk. Okay, good. Thank you. Yeah, I see a few up here. So this one here, did he radiate this one on your upper left chest? No. He did one on the right side, I think. Right. Which I cannot easily see. I think it was right under. In this area somewhere? It\'s right in here. Yeah, it\'s a little bit pink and you\'ve lost the hair, so I\'m guessing that it was right in there. So it looks like that did a good job for you. Yeah, you got a little bit of a rash going under here. And then you\'ve got something here. Was this another skin cancer there or just something else? Okay. Something else. Okay. All right. You can put that down. All right. That gives me a pretty good idea what we\'re dealing with. Okay. Okay. So I\'ll reach out to Dr. Richards and we\'ll kind of just chat through your case. And if she thinks surgery is a bad idea for this, then we\'ll set you up for some immunotherapy. Okay. Thank you. Okay, sounds good. All right. Nice to meet you. That\'s it for today, yes, sir. I\'ll give you a call and let you know what she has to say about that."",""diarized_transcript_csv_url"":"""",""coding_information"":""\\n\\nVISIT TYPE: Outpatient \\nNEW OR FOLLOW-UP: Follow-up\\nComplexity:\\nDIAGNOSIS:\\n1.

Yes. And she's cut a lot of them off of you over the years. Yeah. And you've had radiation to some. Mm-hmm. It sounds like the wrinkle lately is that you had to start blood thinners in December? No, I've been on them for a few years. Oh, okay. Yeah, probably seven or eight. Oh, seven or eight years. years you've been off of them when I go into Sear because she makes me bleed. Yes, yeah. Okay. Yeah, because her notes had said something about not being able to do mose because of the blood thinners, and I thought, we'll just stop the blood thinners for a couple of years. Yeah, I still bleed even before I call myself a bleeder, but she didn't. Between her trying to clean the blood out while she's operating, it wasn't easy. Yeah. And then the last hue on my face that she did her on my hair. head, um, the painkiller wouldn't stop. I mean, it, it was just unbearable. She put in five times the normal amount to get dead in the area. And she hit it in a minute she started just. So after that, then I started doing radiation on some of them. And, uh, then I've got one here. And then Thank you. a couple on my arm, and Dr. Shimuzu, who was doing the radiation, says he won't do radiation below the elbow or below the knee. So he did, we finished this one a month ago. It's not quite healed yet, but, and then he said he won't do that one. Okay. And so, um, and Dr. Richards can't cut that one off? I think she could, or someone could. Thank you. okay yeah and I don't have I mean I guess when you get older I've got neuropathy and I don't have a lot of feeling but the ones that she's cut off before took a while to heal yeah I mean things on the lower extremities tend not to heal super well because your circulation's not great right you know even even people with relatively good circulation things heal slower down there Thank you. Yeah. And if you have some trouble with your circulation, then that can certainly magnify that. So what are the most problematic areas right now? So the left lower leg there. This one was about that size. We started the radiation, and this is similar. I can take this off. Yeah. Let's have a look there. And I might take a picture for my chart. Right. Can I throw this here? I try and keep it covered. Yeah. Are you putting anything on it right now? Yeah, Mew, it's a salve. Okay. Meepierison, maybe? Yeah, that's right. Oh, right. And I don't know, is there something else better to do than that one? I mean, that's an antibiotic cream. Thank you. it will it will keep it from getting infected it's not going to do anything about the cancer there though this allows me to this allows me to put the photo right into your chart. without having to save it anywhere, which is nice. I don't have my measuring thing with me. All right, so there's that guy. I've got this here and here. They've been there for over a year. Okay. She did five biopsies. It was here, here, here, here. Thank you. I think this one maybe six recently. Okay. And they all came back, squamous cell. Okay. And this guy, this looks more like a basil cell, but it's not really specific looking. Do you remember if that one was a basal cell or a squamous cell? They told me all of them were squamous. But, you know, I don't know. Yeah, let's see. The last one, actually Dr. Shemizo's note kind of had the best summer. Thank you. of everything. Let's see here. So the latest crop, they biopsyed a bunch of them in March. Chest with squamous cell. One of the ones on the right forearm is a basal cell. Right radial dorsal hand is basal cell. Okay. Right ulnar dorsal hand. Thank you. so this one out here that one's squamous cell and they said it was in sight to when they biopsied it right thigh was a squamous cell left upper back basil cell let me see if I've got one on the left lower leg was this from Shamos? That was from Shemuzzo's note yeah they just did she just did five of them two weeks ago Thank you. And then they called me with the results. They said they were all squamous cell, but this one, this one. Okay. I thought she did these two. Okay. So the left lower leg is a squamous cell, is what she told you. Yeah, because she sent the, I see the procedure note from when she did all of those biopsies. but I think she sent the referral before the... pathology came in. Right. I'll have to follow up and get that back. Okay. Yeah. So I know you saw Dr. Bolin a couple of years ago to talk about the possibility of starting immunotherapy or some kind of systemic therapy to try to address these, and she felt like it wasn't quite right at that time. So what we use systemic therapy for, what it's approved for, is if you have locally advanced skin cancers that cannot be addressed any other way, either with radiation or with surgery. If they can be addressed that way, that's still the best thing. And I think, I don't know, this one on the leg looks pretty gnarly. Have you seen anyone other than Dr. Richards and Dr. Shemezu about that one? No? Okay. So no other surgeons have been involved. and so my just have to call Dr. Richards and talk through this with her a little bit, because I feel like that one potentially could be addressed surgically, but maybe there's something about this that I don't know. There's some reason why they can't just send you to a plastic surgeon or some of their kind of surgeon to remove that. As you know, you've got to come off blood thinners temporarily for anything like that but that's that's doable I understand that mose on the scalp and face is not really working out anymore it sounds like you're not getting effective pain relief from the injections anymore is there anything now your skin looks pretty inflamed right now is she have you putting something on that she did a blue light on Friday oh she blew light Friday okay so she said it'd be 10 days or so it'll be Thank you. Okay. Looking pretty bad. And then you're also on a medication three times a week, the Acetretton? I haven't taken it. Oh, okay. I just got it. She just put me on it. Oh, okay. I just picked it up the other day, but when I read all the, read about it, I've had heart failure. And then also, and that's the reason I'm on blood thinners. Um But that was eight years ago, and I'm still here, so thankful about that. Yeah. But when I read on that, I have two glasses of wine every night. That helps me relax and go to sleep. And we live in a vineyard, so I've been a wine drinker all my life. And it says you can't drink any alcohol with that. And I don't know whether that's the truth. I mean, most of them say don't drink. and drive and all that. Yeah, yeah. But I'm not going to stop my alcohol just to take this. And when I say that, unless it's a matter of life or death, I don't know, is this going to help me enough to offset, you know, something I enjoy? Yeah. So, I mean, I don't think it's an absolute. I think the combination probably increases the risk of liver toxicity. And Thank you. And so you just have to monitor that. The idea behind that medication is that it would slow the development of these skin cancers and reduce the need for her to cut on you. Right. Okay. And that's a good thing to try to do whenever possible, you know, do a preventative approach. So what I have to offer is really for the treatment of advanced skin cancers. Okay. I think this one on your leg would probably qualify if it truly is not resectable. Are there any other significant skin cancers right now besides the ones you've shown me? So it's mostly the arms and legs right now. Yeah. And there's one in the back, which I think she did that just as a precaution. And because when I was with Shemizu, he said, I'm not going to do that when you're not ready to have. Thank you. that one radiated. Yeah, so they're kind of just watching that one. Yeah. Yeah. But yeah, I think what she's doing with the, you know, with the blue light and have you also done the 5FU cream? No. No? Okay, so we haven't even gotten to those things yet. But yeah, it looks like the blue light did a pretty good job for you. Yeah, I felt it. Uh-huh. Yeah, your skin's pretty, pretty inflamed right now. So hopefully over the next Thank you. week or two here that will all kind of it'll probably a lot of it'll peel and um okay and then it'll be a little smoother after that um so yeah those kind of treatments are definitely the best kinds of preventive treatments um so it's good that she's doing all of that stuff so um if this one on your leg is not amenable to a surgical approach and dr shemizu says we can't radiate it um Thank you. then we could talk about immunotherapy. And so before I jump into that, let me at least run through the rest of your medical history here. Okay. Because I know there's quite a bit going on there. So you mentioned that you have a history of heart failure. Did you have a heart attack in the past? No, I just had heart failure. Okay. Just had heart failure. Okay. Did they know what paused it? No. My family history is, Thank you. that died of weak hearts based on what I know and so I've and my brother just had a heart transplant and he's seven years younger than I am he had a heart that was he needed a new one to live I see so but I don't know what caused it or outside of and that was diagnosed around 2017 yes okay and And do you have like a pacemaker or anything like that? I have a defibrillator. Defibrillator, okay. And I got that at that time. Okay. All right. And you've really been on blood thinners then kind of since that time? Right. All right. And I see, yeah, you're on intresto for the CHF. Who is your cardiologist, by the way? Oh, a new one, Dr. Chang. Okay. Thank you. At Scripps. Okay. All right. And then diabetes you've had since 2010, and you mentioned you've got some neuropathy from that? Yeah, I've had neuropathy for, I think, 20 years. Okay. I don't have a lot of feeling in my feet. Yeah. Any other complications from the diabetes that you know of, like kidney trouble or? Not so. more um who's primary care for you um i haven't been to a primary care physician and it was dr brunston insidus but i don't i think someone took over his practice oh goodness somebody with this many medical problems needs a primary care doctor okay um who's managing your diabetes um i get prescription renewals uh maybe was through dr Thank you. office. I just don't remember the last time I was there was three years ago. Oh, geez. That's not okay. Well, I do have, I've been seen Dr. Pearlman, have been in Dr. Pearlman's office in Santee. Okay. I guess I, I do have someone I've been going to now and then, and they give me the diabetic treatment. Okay. So somebody at Perlman Clinic is sort of. I'm on Mojaro. Yes. Thank you. Okay. And Farsiga as well? Farksiga, yeah. It was recommended by my cardiologist. Okay. And then it looks like you're on, so just some vitamins and supplements and things. Beyond that. Okay. And the only allergy is penicillin. Never smoker. A couple glasses of wine a day. any other major medical history I should be aware of, surgeries, hospitalizations, nothing like that. I've been in the hospital three times since 2017 with heart. Heart believing stuff. Yeah. Okay. Is that usually over at scripts when you do get? Yeah. Okay. All righty. I had a fall. I was actually in, that was two years ago. I hit my head pretty bad, and I went to, Thank you. Sharp for that. I forgot about that. And then, let's see. And so you live over? I live in Lakeside. Lakeside, okay. And Dr. Bruntz was the PCP before? Yeah, he was the one before. How do you spell that? B-R-U. Thank you. N-T-Z or S-T, Brunst, B-R-U-S-T. N-S-T. Okay. Great. I just want to make sure you've plugged in with care for all that stuff. And then in terms of family history, it sounds like just mostly cardiac stuff. Both parents had heart failure, brother had a heart transplant. is there any family history of cancer at all? No, not really. Not really? Okay. All righty. Yeah, so immunotherapy. If we were going to consider that, that is an IV medication that you get once every three weeks. And it does work really well for squamous-type skin cancers. We see about a 60 to 70% response rate. Thank you. which is quite good, and it works fairly quickly. If it works, you know, it could clear up this lesion here probably within a few months. It works okay on basal cells as well, but it's much, much slower, so it can take many more months to really see a change on a basil, which is important since you have a mix of both of those things, some of these spots are going to rest. Thank you. respond really well to that and some of them might not so much. So it is very different than chemotherapy in that chemotherapy, you get the medication, it causes side effects rather predictably within the first week or so, and then those side effects kind of dissipate as the medication leaves your system. Amynotherapy works with your immune system to get your immune system to fight cancer. And so the side effects are on. predictable because it relies on how your immune system responds. So seven out of ten people will cruise through immunotherapy with very mild side effects or even no side effects. And some of the stuff that we see commonly, we see skin dryness, rashes, itching fairly commonly. We also see some patients just feel slightly fatigued after their infusions. Usually it's pretty Thank you. pretty minor. And that seems to just last a day or two. And then not infrequently, we have thyroid problems associated with it. Probably as many as 10% of patients will end up developing hypothyroidism and have to go on a thyroid pill. And that's because the immune system can attack the thyroid gland. And that is not reversible. So a lot of the other side effects will go away once you come off the treatment. But if it attacks the thyroid or the adrenal gland or your pancreas, then you're forever dependent on some sort of hormone replacement from that. And that's an important thing to know. Other side effects that can occur with immunotherapy, so it's pretty wild because it can be, you know, it can be anything from no side effects to people have died from the side effects and everything in between. So rarely people can have more serious side effects like inflammation of the lungs or the liver. Lung is fairly common with these. That one is significant enough that it needs treatment, maybe 3% of patients, which doesn't sound like a big number, but we use a lot of this. So I've certainly seen my share of pneumonitis with it. most of those side effects If they're really mild, like if you get a skin rash, for example, we'll give you some cream to manage it and things like that if it's mild and we'll kind of try to carry on with the treatment. If it's more significant, like if you get inflammation in your lungs, we pause the treatment and we usually will put you on steroids for a little while to cool the immune system back down. And most of the time that is successful. Occasionally the immune system gets so revved up that we have to use special medications. to calm it down. So these treatments have been a real game changer for a lot of cancers. And for guys with really advanced skin cancers where there's not other good options for them, they can be a really important tool in our toolbox. And most people sail through these treatments with little to no side effects. But it is important to know that for a small percentage of patients, some really bad stuff can happen. So we don't use them. Thank you. lightly. Okay. So this is used for all different kinds of cancers? Yeah, we use immunotherapy for lots of things. The first thing that we used it for a lot was actually melanoma, which is a very immune-driven kind of cancer. And so most of what we know about immunotherapy, we learned from melanoma. But it's used in kidney cancer, lung cancer, GI cancer. There's a lot of different cancers. Now we're using immunotherapy. Thank you. But yeah, we really, we really just use it when local therapies have failed or no longer an option. And we may be sort of approaching that with you. I think the big question is really this one on your leg here. It looks like that's been there for a pretty long time. Probably six months. Yeah. Not, I mean, it started like that. Yeah. Yeah. And now it's all ulcerated in the middle. Yeah. And when he took this off, it was just like this. Actually, this one would bigger than that one. Yeah. Okay. So I think I can justify a trial of immunotherapy for this one if Dr. Richards says that surgery, and it wouldn't be a Mose, it would be like having you see a surgeon. If she says that that's not an option, then I think we could consider it. What would you think about that? I'd be okay with it, but if it can be a surgeon. Thank you. can get rid of it. Now, if one on the immunotherapy, it would take care of everything, right? Yeah, so it would probably work on a lot of these other spots as well. Okay, so we'd clean them all up at the same time. You'd need to probably stay on it for at least a year. So coming in every three weeks for a year, which is a little bit of a pain. That's not bad. It was 15 straight days on the radiation. Thank you. No, it was 22 days in a row. Yeah. I've done that five times now. Okay. So, I can deal with once every three weeks or whatever. Yeah. Okay. All right, so I'll talk to Dr. Richards and get her thoughts about that one in particular. And... Is there any issues with immunotherapy and my heart failure or these medications? There shouldn't be. Okay. No. Cardiac side effects from immunotherapy extremely rare. Thank you. And none of these things should really interact with it because none of them are immunosuppressive or anything like that. So it should be fine. Now, you mentioned that you're kind of a bleeder even before you started on the elegance? No, just since my heart failure. Just since the heart failure. Okay, that makes sense. Before that, yeah, because I'd never been on any medications. Okay, okay. I just wanted to make sure that wasn't something we needed to accept. Thank you. explore a little bit more. But yeah, now since the heart failure, you've been on blood thinning medications. And I don't know if any of the stuff you're on is like if you have, if you're on fish oil or omega-3s or any of that, that can do a little bit too. Yeah, I don't do the fish oil and then I know I'm going to have surgery. Yeah. Yeah, because that, uh, uh, people underestimate that one, but that can really make you bleed. Yeah. Well, I was doing fish oil and... the, um, whatever else I was taking and, yeah, eloquists. Yeah, uh-huh. Yeah, those together, you're probably just one giant bruise, huh? Yeah. Yeah. All right, come on up here. I'm going to do a quick look over you. Thank you. Not find the lens anywhere, which is good. Thank you. That sounds okay, couple deep breaths. Good, it looks out all right. Let me take a little bit more of a look here. I'm going to look at your back. Okay, you've got a lot of seborriac keratosis as well. these kind of barnacles. everywhere. Those guys are benign. They're just annoying. You got a really good one right there. And then this bandage in the middle of your back here, this was another biopsy she did. Oh yeah, it's still under the bandage. Uh-huh. Oh, okay. Do you want me to take it off? Yeah, you can take it off. I could, uh. Yeah, that's healed up all right. Okay. Thank you. All right. Let me take a look at your trunk. Okay, good. Thank you. Yeah, I see a few up here. So this one here, did he radiate this one on your upper left chest? No. He did one on the right side, I think. Right. Which I cannot easily see. I think it was right under. In this area somewhere? It's right in here. Yeah, it's a little bit pink and you've lost the hair, so I'm guessing that it was right in there. So it looks like that did a good job for you. Yeah, you got a little bit of a rash going under here. And then you've got something here. Was this another skin cancer there or just something else? Okay. Something else. Okay. All right. You can put that down. All right. That gives me a pretty good idea what we're dealing with. Okay. Okay. So I'll reach out to Dr. Richards and we'll kind of just chat through your case. And if she thinks surgery is a bad idea for this, then we'll set you up for some immunotherapy. Okay. Thank you. Okay, sounds good. All right. Nice to meet you. That's it for today, yes, sir. I'll give you a call and let you know what she has to say about that."", 'diarized_transcript_csv_url': ''}"

Evaluation and management of marginal zone lymphoma of the parotid gland

DISEASE HISTORY:
The  patient  has  a  known  diagnosis  of  Extranodal  Marginal  Zone  Lymphoma  of  the  Parotid  Gland  previously  determined  to  be  Stage IE,  following  surgical  excision.  Historical  PET  CT  scans  indicated  no  detectable  malignancy  beyond  the  localized  site.  A  recent biopsy,  however,  from  a  bronchoscopic  procedure  has  indicated  involvement  in  the  lung,  suggesting  further  spread. 04/15/25:  Patient  presents  for  followup  of  marginal  zone  lymphoma.  Outside  review  of  biopsies  at  MSK  confirmed  marginal  zone lymphoma  in  both  parotid  gland  and  lung  biopsy.  Imaging  review  with  radiologists  from  both  institutions  revealed  evidence  of pulmonary  fibrosis  in  both  lungs,  which  is  believed  to  be  related  to  the  lymphoma.  Patient  reports  feeling  well  currently.  CAT  scan from  November  2024  showed  the  same  pattern  of  fibrosis  that  was  later  seen  on  PET  scan.  Pulmonary  fibrosis  is  noted  to  be irreversible.  No  recent  respiratory  symptoms  reported.05/19/25:  Patient  presents  for  first  chemotherapy  treatment  with  Bendamustine­Rituximab  regimen.  Patient  reports  experiencing night  sweats  and  occasional  chills,  but  denies  fevers.  Patient  notes  some  shortness  of  breath  when  climbing  stairs  but  not  at  rest. Patient  reports  decreased  water  intake  compared  to  his  previous  habits.  Patient  is  currently  taking  an  antibiotic  for  a  tooth  infection, which  is  improving.  Patient  also  reports  having  pulmonary  fibrosis  with  persistent  phlegm  that  he  has  difficulty  expectorating,  and notes  one  episode  where  he  coughed  up  blood.  Patient  has  contacted  his  pulmonologist  about  this  issue.

INTERVAL HISTORY:
08/11/25: Rafael presents for follow-up and fourth cycle of Bendamustine-Rituximab chemotherapy. He reports significant improvement in cough symptoms, which is consistent with positive response to treatment. Rafael has gained weight, increasing from 191 to 201 pounds. He reports experiencing occasional constipation during his third cycle, with two episodes of difficult bowel movements, but denies current issues. He continues to exercise regularly at the gym. Rafael reports experiencing fatigue, particularly after eating. He also mentions occasional acid reflux. No neuropathy, numbness, or tingling in extremities reported. The parotid area is healing well with only localized numbness at the surgical site.

ALLERGIES:
No known allergies
No known drug allergies

MEDICATIONS:
Continued medications: Akynzeo (fosnetupitant) 235 mg-0.25 mg intravenous powder for solution, ALLOPURINOL 300MG TABLETS, bendamustine 100 mg intravenous powder for solution, bendamustine 100 mg intravenous powder for solution, prednisone 2.5 mg tablet, Riabni 10 mg/mL intravenous solution, SULFAMETHOXAZOLE/TRIMETHOPRIM DS  800-160 MG TABS, Treanda 100 mg intravenous powder for solution.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
The ROS is negative in 12 point detail except for the pertinent positives and negatives listed in HPI and below

OBJECTIVE:
Physical Examination:
Gen: Well developed well nourished. HEENT:PERRLA,EOMI, sclera anicteric, oropharynx clear. Nodes: No peripheral adenopathy. Chest: Clear bilaterally. Heart: S1 S2 no murmurs, regular heartbeat. Abd: Soft, +BS, non tender and non distended, no masses, no organomegaly. Ext: No edema. Skin: no rash. Neuro: motor and sensory grossly intact. Musculoskeletal: Normal gait.

IMPRESSION:
1.  Extranodal  Marginal  Zone  Lymphoma  of  the  Parotid  Gland  and  Lungs  (Stage  I):  MSK  review  confirmed  marginal  zone  lymphoma in  both  parotid  gland  and  lung  biopsies.  Imaging  shows  evidence  of  pulmonary  fibrosis  in  both  lungs  believed  to  be  related  to  the lymphoma.  This  is  a  rare  presentation,  with  less  than  5%  of  marginal  zone  lymphoma  cases  reported  worldwide  involving  the  lungs. The  lymphoma  is  likely  to  have  been  present  for  years  before  detection,  which  is  typical  of  this  indolent  disease.  Treatment  is recommended  due  to  the  presence  of  fibrosis.  Patient  is  continuing BR  (Bendamustine­Rituximab)  chemotherapy  today. He reports only mild fatigue and occasional cold sensations. Laboratory values remain stable with normal white blood cell count (4.9) and hemoglobin (12.2). Patient's weight has increased from 191 to 201 pounds, which he attributes to improved exercise routine. Treatment is addressing the nodular pattern observed in the lungs. Significant improvement in persistent cough noted, suggesting positive response to treatment.
2.  Pulmonary  fibrosis:  Bilateral  pulmonary  fibrosis  noted  on  imaging,  now  confirmed  to  be  related  to  the  underlying  lymphoma.  This is  an  irreversible  condition.  Patient  is  unusually  young  to  have  developed  pulmonary  fibrosis,  supporting  the  connection  to  the lymphoma  rather  than  environmental  exposures  or  idiopathic  causes.  Patient  reports  persistent  phlegm  with  difficulty  expectorating and  one  episode  of  hemoptysis.  Patient  will  be  following  up  with  his  pulmonologist  regarding  these  symptoms.  Patient reports marked improvement in cough symptoms.

PLAN:
Continue with Bendamustine-Rituximab chemotherapy regimen for cycles 4-6.
Schedule PET/CT scan after completion of cycle 6.
Continue allergy medication without interruption through end of treatment.
Assess need for continued allopurinol based on today's blood work.
Refill omeprazole for acid reflux symptoms.
Encourage increased water intake, especially during hot weather.
Use stool softener/laxative as needed for constipation.
Continue regular exercise routine to help manage treatment side effects.
Plan for transition to surveillance after cycle 6 with PET/CT scans every 6 months for 2 years, then annually for 3 years.
Schedule follow-up blood tests every 3-4 months.","

test_name: blood tests, test_due_duration: three to four months, estimated_test_due_date: "," Hey, how are you, my friend? Good to see you. How was your vacation? How was your vacation? You look fresh, like a brand new person, yeah. You look younger. I'm serious. Everybody keeps saying it is now. You really look younger. No, I'm saying in your face. Yeah. A little more relaxed. Okay, okay. Alright. Right, good. I have one of our medical students with me, is that what he observes today? Sure. Okay. How are you? This is, sometimes I forget that he even had the coloph. Because that will be here. Yeah. Really? Yeah. Yeah. She would be reminding me. She's like, I don't hear the cough. You know, that's a huge positive because of what we saw on the scan. And that means that, you know, past the six cycles, you're not going to need treatment. Most likely, you're going to put weight back on. I was just going to notice and talk to you about that, too, that most likely we'll talk about maintenance, but it'll be done with treatment after that. After cycle number six, we'll be doing a new PETCT scan, right? Yeah, that's like every so. So once we finish this exactly, then we'll do that again six months later. Okay. It's done every six months for two years. Okay. Then it switches to once a year for three years. so you'll be getting that test for a total of five years. Okay. Okay. All right. All right. Besides the blood tests that we'll be doing every three to four months with me following up and making sure everything is okay. Okay. We're also going to in the PET scan look at this area with the parodic glands again. Ah, okay. How do you feel with that? Can you stick your tongue out? How is that? Okay. So the healing has been good, right? Because before it was deviating. Oh, yeah, yeah, right? Yeah, yeah. Okay. Okay. And then nothing new in that area, right? No. No, the healing is great. Yeah. How do you feel overall? Have you noticed any new side effects? No, no. No, noopathy, numbness, or tingling in your fingers or toes? No. No. No. I mean, over here, still a little numb because I guess the nerve is still. From the surgery itself, yeah. Okay. But I remember the whole skin area was no. Right, but just over here. Okay. All that, I haven't, you know, I've been trying to look at heaven. Okay. Yeah. And anything with... your bathroom habits urination or bowel movements any constipation diarrhea, nausea or vomiting no it was just this is the fourth cycle the third cycle I had a little problem I was taking a long time I was in the bathroom for some reason okay so you were slightly constipated okay it took me it felt like a half an hour yeah but it was coming out like like it was really hard I don't know why Not like that. Okay. That happened, though, two different occasions, you know. Okay. You know, but after that, like, it hasn't been happening. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Okay. I was drinking my water like you were telling me. Got it. So I don't know why that, like that part. Other than that. It could have been something you ate. Now, do you have anything at home in terms of a stool, softener, or laxative that you could use? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. So with this cycle, let's say it happens again, then just go ahead and use that. So it doesn't. become worse right now in terms of your blood counts everything is good your white blood cell count normal at 4.9 your hemoglobin 12.2 your platelet count is at 1 no 217 so that's actually and everything is very good even with the last cycle even though i wasn't here um when you saw natalia and uh all of the lab tests were checked everything was within normal limits oh my god your creatin your liver function tests all of that yes you have told me she's like you know You're living, I said, yeah, because the fact, you're telling me to stick with the water. So I trust me, I think. Yeah, yeah, absolutely. And now we're in the, you know, we're starting a heat wave right now. So you need to really increase your water and take even more, all right? And you did your weight increased from 191 to 201. That's great. Wow. Okay. What are you doing daily activity wise? Oh, I've been talking like I always love the gym, but now with this, you told me, so I keep up with it because it's something I like doing. Okay, but like, good. Especially when you told me, look, that. has helped you, I make sure that I'm at the dream. Great, I mean, that helps with, like, getting oversight effects much faster, too, the more active you were made, right? And that was perfect when you were saying that, because there's something I like doing. When you told me that, I'm like, let's see if it's gonna help even more. Okay. I rock for work, go to the film and go by daily function. Okay, okay, excellent. Have you noticed anything at all, or no, everything's good? Yes, okay, okay, all right. that I like him to be at.

The only thing is that he eats and fall asleep. Okay, you get tired very easily right now. Okay. After he eats, he gets so sleep. Okay. You may see that build up with these last three cycles, you know, the fatigue, but what you're doing remaining active is the best thing so that's fine all right sound good sounds good any refills you need for any of the medications I give you before we head over to the treatment room and if you can let him know he yes okay okay and he stopped taking it oh you need to take that I was all you know so watered those you're like who told you to stop you have to slowly taper out of your system if you ever stop allergy medications like that because once you abruptly stop, the symptoms will come back immediately. Watery eyes, itchy eyes, runny nose, congestion. I couldn't keep my eyes open. So just through the end of treatment, get back on it so that we don't have anything that changes what we need to do with your treatment. I did take it this morning along with that medication. Allopurinol? Okay. So we're going to check with today's blood work if you need to continue that alopeure. and all at all because that's with the initial, you know, first few cycles just in case the side effects of the chemo with what was happening in the lungs and the lymphoma and movement, release those contents of the lymphoma cells into your blood. If you don't need it anymore, we'll stop it. Okay. So just continue with the allergy medication, all right? I'll know from today's blood work in a few days. Okay. All right. Sounds good. Good? Okay. Come with me. Let's go to the treatment area. Thank you for waiting. No, no problem. Yeah. It is. You're right. Come on in. Come on in and have a seat. Good morning. Anywhere you want. Yeah. Yeah, it's open. First come, first serve. Hey, Doc, I just have a question. Sure. No, not, not, it doesn't happen every so often, but once in a while, I get like a little acid refl. That medication that starts with the old. Oh, my personal? Yeah, I'm running a little low. Okay, let me refill that right now. Okay. Use it, use it as much as you need, okay?

Abd: Soft, +BS, non tender and non distended, no masses, no organomegaly. Ext: No edema. Skin: no rash. Neuro: motor and sensory grossly intact. Musculoskeletal: Normal gait.\\n\\nIMPRESSION:\\n1.  Extranodal  Marginal  Zone  Lymphoma  of  the  Parotid  Gland  and  Lungs  (Stage  I):  MSK  review  confirmed  marginal  zone  lymphoma in  both  parotid  gland  and  lung  biopsies.  Imaging  shows  evidence  of  pulmonary  fibrosis  in  both  lungs  believed  to  be  related  to  the lymphoma.  This  is  a  rare  presentation,  with  less  than  5%  of  marginal  zone  lymphoma  cases  reported  worldwide  involving  the  lungs. The  lymphoma  is  likely  to  have  been  present  for  years  before  detection,  which  is  typical  of  this  indolent  disease.  Treatment  is recommended  due  to  the  presence  of  fibrosis.  Patient  is  continuing BR  (Bendamustine\xadRituximab)  chemotherapy  today. He reports only mild fatigue and occasional cold sensations. Laboratory values remain stable with normal white blood cell count (4.9) and hemoglobin (12.2). Patient\'s weight has increased from 191 to 201 pounds, which he attributes to improved exercise routine. Treatment is addressing the nodular pattern observed in the lungs. Significant improvement in persistent cough noted, suggesting positive response to treatment.\\n2.  Pulmonary  fibrosis:  Bilateral  pulmonary  fibrosis  noted  on  imaging,  now  confirmed  to  be  related  to  the  underlying  lymphoma.  This is  an  irreversible  condition.  Patient  is  unusually  young  to  have  developed  pulmonary  fibrosis,  supporting  the  connection  to  the lymphoma  rather  than  environmental  exposures  or  idiopathic  causes.  Patient  reports  persistent  phlegm  with  difficulty  expectorating and  one  episode  of  hemoptysis.  Patient  will  be  following  up  with  his  pulmonologist  regarding  these  symptoms.  Patient reports marked improvement in cough symptoms.\\n\\nPLAN:\\nContinue with Bendamustine-Rituximab chemotherapy regimen for cycles 4-6.\\nSchedule PET/CT scan after completion of cycle 6.\\nContinue allergy medication without interruption through end of treatment.\\nAssess need for continued allopurinol based on today\'s blood work.\\nRefill omeprazole for acid reflux symptoms.\\nEncourage increased water intake, especially during hot weather.\\nUse stool softener/laxative as needed for constipation.\\nContinue regular exercise routine to help manage treatment side effects.\\nPlan for transition to surveillance after cycle 6 with PET/CT scans every 6 months for 2 years, then annually for 3 years.\\nSchedule follow-up blood tests every 3-4 months.\\n\\nPatient has given prior verbal consent to have the conversation recorded and summarized by the Knowtex software."",""date_of_appt"":""Monday, August 11, 2025"",""mrn"":""4097126"",""status"":""Review"",""icd_10_codes"":null,""diarized_transcript"":"" Hey, how are you, my friend? Good to see you. How was your vacation? How was your vacation? You look fresh, like a brand new person, yeah. You look younger. I\'m serious. Everybody keeps saying it is now. You really look younger. No, I\'m saying in your face. Yeah. A little more relaxed. Okay, okay. Alright. Right, good. I have one of our medical students with me, is that what he observes today? Sure. Okay. How are you? This is, sometimes I forget that he even had the coloph. Because that will be here. Yeah. Really? Yeah. Yeah. She would be reminding me. She\'s like, I don\'t hear the cough. You know, that\'s a huge positive because of what we saw on the scan. And that means that, you know, past the six cycles, you\'re not going to need treatment. Most likely, you\'re going to put weight back on. I was just going to notice and talk to you about that, too, that most likely we\'ll talk about maintenance, but it\'ll be done with treatment after that. After cycle number six, we\'ll be doing a new PETCT scan, right? Yeah, that\'s like every so. So once we finish this exactly, then we\'ll do that again six months later. Okay. It\'s done every six months for two years. Okay. Then it switches to once a year for three years. so you\'ll be getting that test for a total of five years. Okay. Okay. All right. All right. Besides the blood tests that we\'ll be doing every three to four months with me following up and making sure everything is okay. Okay. We\'re also going to in the PET scan look at this area with the parodic glands again. Ah, okay. How do you feel with that? Can you stick your tongue out? How is that? Okay. So the healing has been good, right? Because before it was deviating. Oh, yeah, yeah, right? Yeah, yeah. Okay. Okay. And then nothing new in that area, right? No. No, the healing is great. Yeah. How do you feel overall? Have you noticed any new side effects? No, no. No, noopathy, numbness, or tingling in your fingers or toes? No. No. No. I mean, over here, still a little numb because I guess the nerve is still. From the surgery itself, yeah. Okay. But I remember the whole skin area was no. Right, but just over here. Okay. All that, I haven\'t, you know, I\'ve been trying to look at heaven. Okay. Yeah. And anything with... your bathroom habits urination or bowel movements any constipation diarrhea, nausea or vomiting no it was just this is the fourth cycle the third cycle I had a little problem I was taking a long time I was in the bathroom for some reason okay so you were slightly constipated okay it took me it felt like a half an hour yeah but it was coming out like like it was really hard I don\'t know why Not like that. Okay. That happened, though, two different occasions, you know. Okay. You know, but after that, like, it hasn\'t been happening. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Okay. I was drinking my water like you were telling me. Got it. So I don\'t know why that, like that part. Other than that. It could have been something you ate. Now, do you have anything at home in terms of a stool, softener, or laxative that you could use? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. So with this cycle, let\'s say it happens again, then just go ahead and use that. So it doesn\'t. become worse right now in terms of your blood counts everything is good your white blood cell count normal at 4.9 your hemoglobin 12.2 your platelet count is at 1 no 217 so that\'s actually and everything is very good even with the last cycle even though i wasn\'t here um when you saw natalia and uh all of the lab tests were checked everything was within normal limits oh my god your creatin your liver function tests all of that yes you have told me she\'s like you know You\'re living, I said, yeah, because the fact, you\'re telling me to stick with the water. So I trust me, I think. Yeah, yeah, absolutely. And now we\'re in the, you know, we\'re starting a heat wave right now. So you need to really increase your water and take even more, all right? And you did your weight increased from 191 to 201. That\'s great. Wow. Okay. What are you doing daily activity wise? Oh, I\'ve been talking like I always love the gym, but now with this, you told me, so I keep up with it because it\'s something I like doing. Okay, but like, good. Especially when you told me, look, that. has helped you, I make sure that I\'m at the dream. Great, I mean, that helps with, like, getting oversight effects much faster, too, the more active you were made, right? And that was perfect when you were saying that, because there\'s something I like doing. When you told me that, I\'m like, let\'s see if it\'s gonna help even more. Okay. I rock for work, go to the film and go by daily function. Okay, okay, excellent. Have you noticed anything at all, or no, everything\'s good? Yes, okay, okay, all right. that I like him to be at. Yeah, yeah, you had lost weight, so we needed you to gain it back, so you\'re right at 200, 201, so keep doing what you\'re doing. Blood pressure is good. Okay. He has no problem with you. Okay, great. The only thing is that he eats and fall asleep. Okay, you get tired very easily right now. Okay. After he eats, he gets so sleep. Okay. You may see that build up with these last three cycles, you know, the fatigue, but what you\'re doing remaining active is the best thing so that\'s fine all right sound good sounds good any refills you need for any of the medications I give you before we head over to the treatment room and if you can let him know he yes okay okay and he stopped taking it oh you need to take that I was all you know so watered those you\'re like who told you to stop you have to slowly taper out of your system if you ever stop allergy medications like that because once you abruptly stop, the symptoms will come back immediately. Watery eyes, itchy eyes, runny nose, congestion. I couldn\'t keep my eyes open. So just through the end of treatment, get back on it so that we don\'t have anything that changes what we need to do with your treatment. I did take it this morning along with that medication. Allopurinol? Okay. So we\'re going to check with today\'s blood work if you need to continue that alopeure. and all at all because that\'s with the initial, you know, first few cycles just in case the side effects of the chemo with what was happening in the lungs and the lymphoma and movement, release those contents of the lymphoma cells into your blood. If you don\'t need it anymore, we\'ll stop it. Okay. So just continue with the allergy medication, all right? I\'ll know from today\'s blood work in a few days. Okay. All right. Sounds good. Good? Okay. Come with me. Let\'s go to the treatment area. Thank you for waiting. No, no problem. Yeah. It is. You\'re right. Come on in. Come on in and have a seat. Good morning. Anywhere you want. Yeah. Yeah, it\'s open. First come, first serve. Hey, Doc, I just have a question. Sure. No, not, not, it doesn\'t happen every so often, but once in a while, I get like a little acid refl. That medication that starts with the old. Oh, my personal? Yeah, I\'m running a little low. Okay, let me refill that right now. Okay. Use it, use it as much as you need, okay? All right, I\'ll send it now. Okay, thank you, doctor. You\'re welcome. He\'s good to go. Counts are good. He\'s good to go. Counts are good. What is it?

Good to see you. How was your vacation? How was your vacation? You look fresh, like a brand new person, yeah. You look younger. I'm serious. Everybody keeps saying it is now. You really look younger. No, I'm saying in your face. Yeah. A little more relaxed. Okay, okay. Alright. Right, good. I have one of our medical students with me, is that what he observes today? Sure. Okay. How are you? This is, sometimes I forget that he even had the coloph. Because that will be here. Yeah. Really? Yeah. Yeah. She would be reminding me. She's like, I don't hear the cough. You know, that's a huge positive because of what we saw on the scan. And that means that, you know, past the six cycles, you're not going to need treatment. Most likely, you're going to put weight back on. I was just going to notice and talk to you about that, too, that most likely we'll talk about maintenance, but it'll be done with treatment after that. After cycle number six, we'll be doing a new PETCT scan, right? Yeah, that's like every so. So once we finish this exactly, then we'll do that again six months later. Okay. It's done every six months for two years. Okay. Then it switches to once a year for three years. so you'll be getting that test for a total of five years. Okay. Okay. All right. All right. Besides the blood tests that we'll be doing every three to four months with me following up and making sure everything is okay. Okay. We're also going to in the PET scan look at this area with the parodic glands again. Ah, okay. How do you feel with that? Can you stick your tongue out? How is that? Okay. So the healing has been good, right? Because before it was deviating. Oh, yeah, yeah, right? Yeah, yeah. Okay. Okay. And then nothing new in that area, right? No. No, the healing is great. Yeah. How do you feel overall? Have you noticed any new side effects? No, no. No, noopathy, numbness, or tingling in your fingers or toes? No. No. No. I mean, over here, still a little numb because I guess the nerve is still. From the surgery itself, yeah. Okay. But I remember the whole skin area was no. Right, but just over here. Okay. All that, I haven't, you know, I've been trying to look at heaven. Okay. Yeah. And anything with... your bathroom habits urination or bowel movements any constipation diarrhea, nausea or vomiting no it was just this is the fourth cycle the third cycle I had a little problem I was taking a long time I was in the bathroom for some reason okay so you were slightly constipated okay it took me it felt like a half an hour yeah but it was coming out like like it was really hard I don't know why Not like that. Okay. That happened, though, two different occasions, you know. Okay. You know, but after that, like, it hasn't been happening. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Okay. I was drinking my water like you were telling me. Got it. So I don't know why that, like that part. Other than that. It could have been something you ate. Now, do you have anything at home in terms of a stool, softener, or laxative that you could use? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. So with this cycle, let's say it happens again, then just go ahead and use that. So it doesn't. become worse right now in terms of your blood counts everything is good your white blood cell count normal at 4.9 your hemoglobin 12.2 your platelet count is at 1 no 217 so that's actually and everything is very good even with the last cycle even though i wasn't here um when you saw natalia and uh all of the lab tests were checked everything was within normal limits oh my god your creatin your liver function tests all of that yes you have told me she's like you know You're living, I said, yeah, because the fact, you're telling me to stick with the water. So I trust me, I think. Yeah, yeah, absolutely. And now we're in the, you know, we're starting a heat wave right now. So you need to really increase your water and take even more, all right? And you did your weight increased from 191 to 201. That's great. Wow. Okay. What are you doing daily activity wise? Oh, I've been talking like I always love the gym, but now with this, you told me, so I keep up with it because it's something I like doing. Okay, but like, good. Especially when you told me, look, that. has helped you, I make sure that I'm at the dream. Great, I mean, that helps with, like, getting oversight effects much faster, too, the more active you were made, right? And that was perfect when you were saying that, because there's something I like doing. When you told me that, I'm like, let's see if it's gonna help even more. Okay. I rock for work, go to the film and go by daily function. Okay, okay, excellent. Have you noticed anything at all, or no, everything's good? Yes, okay, okay, all right. that I like him to be at. Yeah, yeah, you had lost weight, so we needed you to gain it back, so you're right at 200, 201, so keep doing what you're doing. Blood pressure is good. Okay. He has no problem with you. Okay, great. The only thing is that he eats and fall asleep. Okay, you get tired very easily right now. Okay. After he eats, he gets so sleep. Okay. You may see that build up with these last three cycles, you know, the fatigue, but what you're doing remaining active is the best thing so that's fine all right sound good sounds good any refills you need for any of the medications I give you before we head over to the treatment room and if you can let him know he yes okay okay and he stopped taking it oh you need to take that I was all you know so watered those you're like who told you to stop you have to slowly taper out of your system if you ever stop allergy medications like that because once you abruptly stop, the symptoms will come back immediately. Watery eyes, itchy eyes, runny nose, congestion. I couldn't keep my eyes open. So just through the end of treatment, get back on it so that we don't have anything that changes what we need to do with your treatment. I did take it this morning along with that medication. Allopurinol? Okay. So we're going to check with today's blood work if you need to continue that alopeure. and all at all because that's with the initial, you know, first few cycles just in case the side effects of the chemo with what was happening in the lungs and the lymphoma and movement, release those contents of the lymphoma cells into your blood. If you don't need it anymore, we'll stop it. Okay. So just continue with the allergy medication, all right? I'll know from today's blood work in a few days. Okay. All right. Sounds good. Good? Okay. Come with me. Let's go to the treatment area. Thank you for waiting. No, no problem. Yeah. It is. You're right. Come on in. Come on in and have a seat. Good morning. Anywhere you want. Yeah. Yeah, it's open. First come, first serve. Hey, Doc, I just have a question. Sure. No, not, not, it doesn't happen every so often, but once in a while, I get like a little acid refl. That medication that starts with the old. Oh, my personal? Yeah, I'm running a little low. Okay, let me refill that right now. Okay. Use it, use it as much as you need, okay?
